{"prompt":"","completion":"This ripe wine with its touches of vanilla as well as yellow fruits and acidity has a lightly honeyed character typical of the vintage. Ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Lush aromas of black cherry, vanilla, kola nut and blackberry fudge pack lots of action into this bottling. The palate confirms the complexity, with blueberry and black cherry backed by pipe tobacco, dried marjoram and a pencil lead-driven structure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Meaty, leathery and spicy smelling, which can be typical for the variety. The palate is a bit shrill and acidic, while narrow flavors of red berries, herbs and minty green settle on a lightly herbal finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"An immediately approachable wine with aromas of smoke, crushed stone and dark plum, this is a soft, supple example of its appellation. A bit of caramel emerges on the finish, where it coexists with mixed berry fruit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Under ripe fruit seems more sour than anything. Some bitter, stemmy flavors creep into the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Layered aromas of blackberry, cassis, leather and dried cheese are inviting. Jammy and friendly in the mouth. Candied almost syrupy flavors of blackberry and black cherry finish dense and chocolaty, with modest acidity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Made in a lighter style, this Pinot comes from the cooler Napa side of the Carneros. It's light- to medium-bodied and dry, with a silky texture and pleasant flavors of cherries, exotic dusty spices and sandalwood. Elegant and moderate in alcohol, it's a wine to drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of quince and lemon see the stage for flavors of green apple, quince and geranium leaf. Floral notes overpower fruit flavors, and the finish is slightly stiff for a white wine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This aromatic wine offers notes of apricot, flowers and jasmine. It drinks off dry with abundant stone fruit flavors."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This brawny, one-dimensional red offers flavors of raisin, dark spice, a note of powdered sage and the heat of evident alcohol. Bracing, grainy tannins leave a sharp finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Great structure, great acidity, with the ripe fruit pierced with acidity. The tannins are hugely powerful and dry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Creamy, concentrated waves of vanilla and cherry, with just a hint of almond, open the way to high-toned structure and integrated tannin and oak, finishing balanced and bright."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This leads with mocha, herb and leather aromas. The palate is still tight and closed but offers red berry, clove and sage hints with some air. Clenched tannins grip the close."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Barrel notes of vanilla and spice take the lead in this aromatically brooding wine, followed by dried herbs and dark fruit. The flavors are pitch black, coating the palate from end to end with layers of fruit, tannins that go the distance and a graphite-filled finish that lingers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Located on high ground to the east of Cahors, this estate was replanted in the 1980s at a high density. Rich, smooth and dense, this shows concentrated ripe plum and juicy blackberry flavors and, above all, firm tannins. Wood aging has smoothed the rough edges."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a 100% varietal wine sourced from the coveted Oakville Ranch Vineyard on the eastern edge of the appellation. Cedar, herb, meat and soy mingle around a full-bodied weight softened by the wine's classic edge, length and breadth of black fruit and vanilla oak."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Dark garnet in color, this wine proffers a bouquet of cassis, dark plum and lavender. There is a nice combination of fruit and savory flavors, notably black cherry, strawberry, espresso, smoked meat and oregano. Soft almost sneaky tannins appear on the palate and then retreat just in time for a vivid finish sprinkled with just a touch of Mediterranean herbs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a fine effort; the fruit smacks of cut pear, pineapple and light tropical flavors. It's textural and tangy, with a pleasing citrus skin finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"It's hard to get very excited about this wine because it's so average and common. It smells weakly of lemons, and the citrus flavors are watery and thin. It's dry and although there's some good acidity, it feels flat in the mouth. That says it all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A sweet, medium-bodied style of Pinot Gris, with honeyed flavors of apple, pear and pineapple. Despite the sweetness, the finish is nicely balanced, with a lush texture. Even prettier is the wine's pale copper hue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this is a wine that imparts great intensity and a wide range of aromas including red fruit, dried mint leaf, root beer and white truffle. It boasts a beautiful color, firm tannins and smoky flavors in the mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Intensely ripe black cherries and plums lend heft to this rich, boldly textured Pinot Noir. It's a nuanced wine, accented by hints of dried herbs, violets and a crush of mineral tones that elongate the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This elegantly structured wine is a wonderful expression of Sauvignon's serious side, offering delicate yellow stone fruit, wildflower and toasted nut scents. On the polished, full-bodied palate, a hint of nectarine backs up creamy yellow peach fruit while fresh acidity lends balance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A wine that combines richness with a great structure. It is ripe, smoky, the red fruits rich and concentrated. A wine that is packed with juicy fruit and also with a good aging potential."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a balanced blend of the three major Champagne grapes from a producer in the Marne Valley. With its high proportion of Pinot Meunier, it has a soft and rich character. Attractive and fruity, it's ready to drink."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Subdued aromas of strawberry, rose petal and toast come together in the glass. The palate offers bright red berry and a hint of green tea alongside polished tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a full-bodied yet succulent, supple wine, loaded with dark fruit. Black cherries and plums hint at sur-maturit√©, framed in a soft wrap of baking spices and mocha."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Lemon-scented Mirabelle notes hover on the nose and turn into fully fledged, ripe plum on the palate where the seam of fresh, enlivening and brightening acidity sets a lively theme. The body is light, the finish is dry and the overall impression is one of light-footed playfulness and ease. You might almost forget to notice the more textured, structured core which underlies all this and will allow it to age beautifully. Drink now through 2025."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A wood-aged white with light toast character to complement the creamy pear and melon flavors. It is full in the mouth, rounded and soft."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Entirely sourced from this Sangiacomo family-farmed vineyard, which is planted entirely to the Old Wente clone, this wine offers fleshy and tropical juiciness and texture. Aged in French oak, the vast majority of it neutral, the wine lets the fruit and acidity speak for themselves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Hard and showing an herbal edge, this single-vineyard Merlot will require some further bottle age and\/or decanting. It drinks more like a Cabernet than a Merlot, with a green slant to the tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of violet, dark-skinned berry and baking spice are the highlights. On the bright, juicy palate, soft velvety tannins frame mature black cherry, blackberry and a hint of cocoa."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a most affordable Pinot, a blend of multiple clones and vineyards, and it's a gem. Full and fruity from the moment you pull the cork, it hits you with flavors of ripe strawberry, blackberry and black cherry, a big mouthful of lush fruit flavor. The finish brings on hints of truffle, licorice and dark chocolate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Peach and flower aromas are pleasant and light. This is also delicate and airy across the palate, while sweet, candied flavors of lychee, apple and green melon finish sweet, on the verge of cloying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Light plum and raspberry aromas include notes of animal and latex. This lightweight Garnacha has a monotone mouthfeel, while hollow simple berry flavors finish with acidic tang."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This Sauvignon Blanc is neutral on the nose except for a smack of lime. Mild on the palate, this tastes of briny, salty citrus fruits and peels. A fresh finish confirms that this is straightforward but enjoyable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This rich wine is full and has a good balance of acidity and fruit. The lightly mineral texture gives bite and crispness. It is still a young, tight wine needing another few months. Drink from 2026."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Light and lively, this has crisp apple and citrus aromas, nicely tangy fruit flavors and relatively light body. It feels juicy but lean rather than rich, in a refreshing alternative style."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This wine shows both beautifully ripe fruit and a tight mineral streak that will keep it on the straight and narrow. It does need to age and the wine will be best from 2028."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"California Viognier doesn't get any richer than this. Although it's dry, it has high-alcohol glycerine that gives a honeyed sweetness to the flamboyant pineapple, nectarine, peach and lemon cream flavors. Drink this unctuously soft wine as a cocktail by itself with savory appetizers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Quite earthy and sun-baked to start, with raisiny aromas that come with cola and leather. Thick, dense and heavy in the mouth, with concentrated, baked flavors of blackberry, pepper and bitter chocolate. A superripe, inky wine with soft tannins and a spongey finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This cool-vintage blend brings light aromas of woodspice, and dried and fresh herbs, with dark cherries lurking in the background. The acids are bright and tart, while the tannins bring some grit, with coffee flavors lingering on the finish. It needs time to come together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Structured but straightforward, it opens with a pretty fragrance of white flowers, yellow apples and a whiff of bread crust, all of which carry over to the ripe, round palate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Some firm tannins give solid structure and smoky character to this wine, an exotic blend of Merlot, Abouriou and Malbec. The juicy berry fruits are round and full in the mouth. It's a ripe wine, with a solid structure that gives balance to the fruitiness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Ripe and soft with rich apple flavor, there's a fullness to this wine. While elegant with a touch of maturity from bottle ageing, the palate is freshened a crispness and levity characteristic of the house style. It has enough weight to accompany food and is ready to drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Dark in color, this is a rich, opulent, almost showy wine. The fruit is ripe, a combination of the sweetest strawberries with black cherries, laced with rich acidity. Then the tannins power in, a dry core of structure and density. Impressive and long-lasting, don't touch this wine for another six years at least."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"An herbaceous selection, this leads with aromas of just-dried grass and yellow florals that are coupled with notes of green plum, melon rind and lime pith. The medium-weight palate is lifted by ample acidity, although the finish ends ripe and fruity. Drink up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Pretty scents of rosewater, raspberries and cherries introduce this light and pleasing wine. It carries some of the charm of a good strawberry soda, with forward fruit and a delicate frame. That said, it is not just a simple fruity wine, and gains weight and complexity as it breathes. Give it time to show you all it has."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A touch of yeast and sage emerges amidst lime peel scents on the nose of this wine. The palate reinforces those flavors, while white pepper and lime notes tingle around the edges. It's lean but concentrated and finishes with such a clean and refreshing zip that you just want to sip more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Oak-influenced notes of cherry, strawberry preserves, pastis, nutmeg and leather. Medium to full bodied, this wine feels round on entrance, with its tannins and acids picking up steam as it progresses across the palate. The long, tangy finish tastes of bloody meat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Estate-grown from a small family winery and entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is savory in earthy truffle, subdued plum, black cherry and tobacco leaf. A complex intermingling of pencil shavings and cedar round things out. On the palate the generous tannins are sure to smooth over time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Slightly rustic earthy aromas of animal, blackberry, plum and cola feed into a jammy palate with just enough acidic pop. Chocolaty blackberry flavors are touched up by resiny oak, while this blend of 85% Monastrell and 15% Syrah tastes similar on a persistent finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The nose is quite subdued, it offers buoyant orange and apricot flavors. An easy, juicy wine, neatly balanced with brisk, citrusy acidity. Drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A bright, fresh Syrah delicious in restrained blackberry and blueberry fruit, it has a luscious mouthfeel, plenty of acidity and an undercurrent of wild herb. This wine is a standout, ready to pair with something gamey dribbled in black pepper sauce."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A ripe full wine shows the richness of this appellation and also its potential for aging. Its lime and green-plum fruits are shot through with acidity and balanced by a tangy rich texture. Drink from 2028."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"This easy-drinking Shiraz features some plummy‚Äîalmost pruny‚Äîfruit aromas, facile plum and berry flavors, little tannin and bright acids on the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is the winery's best blend. It's been a consistently excellent wine, showing a fuller body, richer, deeper fruit and an oakier overlay than the regular Pinot Noir. The red fruits veer into blue and black fruits, even ripe blue plums and mocha. With some dusty tannins, it could develop over the next six years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Here's a lofty, noble Cab that boasts great power and intensity. The nose is redolent of black plum, spice, green leaf, molasses and a touch of cinnamon. Firm tannins and thick density back its penetrating effect."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Dark fruit and astringent tannins make for a bold and hearty first impression. Opens with a dark inky color and delivers aromas of prune, plum, cola, tar and old spice. Pair it with aged Pecorino cheese."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a good, solid Pinot Noir, a little rustic and direct, but offering lots of drinking pleasure. It's dry and silky, with rich black cherry, raspberry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Drink over the next year or two."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Fruity and medium dry, this is soft, with citrus hits to balance the sweetness. The wine is bright and light in the mouth, better as an ap√©ritif than with food."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"An austere nose gives way in time to smoky tobacco, red currant and minerally acidity, the wine intense on the palate without being over the top. Along the way, hits of cedar and milk chocolate complement the proceedings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A wine is concentrated from the low yields and wonderfully juicy, fresh fruits. Apple and spiced pear flavors are totally freshened by the bright, crisp acidity. Drink from 2024."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A superb, mature wine that is ripe, toasty and full of yellow- and white-fruit flavors. A fine balance brings up spice, an opulent texture, a taut edge of steel and a feeling that this fine wine is ready to drink. It can age, and it will be better over the next few years as its secondary aromas stay in balance with the fruitiness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"For the price, this is a solid Chardonnay, offering up just you might expect. Hints of toasty oak, a suggestion of custardy textural richness and intense citrus fruit come together in a medium-bodied wine that should prove versatile at the table through the end of 2026."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Hints of spring ramps and earth blow off with aeration to reveal pretty floral and lemon aromas on this off-dry, single-vineyard Pinot Blanc. The palate is a bit demure in fruit concentration, but brisk lemon-lime acidity shines through the richly textured palate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This medium- to full-bodied wine manages to be mouth-filling and round without being excessively soft or syrupy. A savory, meaty, coffee-like note complements the ripe blackberry fruit, which persists a good long time on the finish. Drink now‚Äì2025."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Subdued aromas of pear peel give way to fleshy pear fruit framed with grapefruit acidity. Harmonious and reined-in, the wine combines elegance with fruity concentration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"There's a cut of acidity that slices through the richness, interfering with the palate's enjoyment of this dry, silky Pinot Noir. Its flavors are of cherry tart, with the sweet, smoky crust, and a splash of cherry liqueur. Drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This wine is all fruit, ripe and full in the mouth. Touches of wood aging have given an extra dimension to the berry fruits and bright acidity. It's ready to drink."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a very good, everyday bubbly. It's dryish and crisp, with honey, orange, strawberry and leesy flavors. The mouthfeel is a little rough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of Sherry and barrel resin are all you get from this wood-fermented, oxidized number. While neither foul nor severe, the all-wood nature of this is overly dominant and not pleasant enough to stand on its own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Pretty aromas show concentrated lemon and honey highlights. Once tasted, they carry through with flavors of orange marmalade, maple syrup and brown sugar. Sweet but not cloying, it's a slice of lemon pie in a glass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Standard berry aromas show touches of raisin and earth, but not too much of either. It feels fresh, crisp and alert, with cherry tomato, berry fruit, tobacco and vanilla flavors. This feels healthy but not real deep or complex on the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Slightly floral on the nose, with some pear and nectarine as well, this light-bodied wine blends sweet stone-fruit flavors with tart green apples on the palate, giving it a degree of balance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Peppery, berry-ish, full-fruited smokiness. This has verve, energy and dark blackberry fruit while freshness lends focus. Very enjoyable indeed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Intense and elegant, it brings together sensations of violet, crushed red berry, mineral and cake spices that are supported by firm but fine tannins and brisk acidity. Fermented with wild yeasts, it illustrates the vibrant character of the vintage. Drink 2022‚Äì2040."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Savory aromas of roasting meat and beef jerky are enhanced by pretty touches of lilacs, violet and chocolate syrup on the nose of this bottling. The slightest kiss of strawberry shows on the sip, followed by riper blackberry, purple flowers, rosemary and pepper. The firm tannic structure ensures ageability."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Engaging scents suggesting rose, iris, perfumed berry and Mediterranean herb meld together in the glass. The soft, bright palate offers red cherry, raspberry, a hint of tobacco and a coffee note alongside supple tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of moist underbrush, violet, red berry and a whiff of espresso lead the way. The simple, somewhat diluted palate delivers fresh strawberry and a note of white pepper with easygoing tannins and bright acidity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"From the C√¥tes de Provence, this is a lightweight sparkling ros√© wine that boasts tasty strawberry and sour-apple flavors. A hint of chocolate creeps in on the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Opening with a pretty honeysuckle nose, this Viognier is completely in balance, with layers of lime and pineapple and restrained weight. Enjoy with Thai papaya salad or ceviche."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A steely wine, its acidity dominating the attractive toast, white fruits and grapefruit flavors. It is rich, full in the mouth, a wine that shows some opulence while also preserving a firm, strict structure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Too soft by far, with sugary sweet, medicinal cherry-berry flavors and a sharp cut of acidity. Tastes like an inexpensive Port."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A bit crude in tannins and with some green flavors, but not bad for this price. Gives enough blackberry, licorice and cedar flavors to satisfy, and the finish is dry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Sultry and inviting aromas of buttercream, custard and white peach are sliced by Meyer-lemon juice, salt and jasmine on the nose of this single-vineyard expression. It's finely tuned on the palate, delivering butterscotch and pecan flavors dissected by razor-sharp acidity and a chalky texture."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Soft richness of the vintage, its tannins are velvety and ripe. Blackberry fruits and mint shine through the smoky edge of tannins to give a wine that has both generous fruits and a tight end that brings in bright acidity. It is just ready to drink, although it will be better from 2026."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Smells fresh and lemony, with accents of smoke and butter. You also get sweetish lemon flavors, with a real attack of acidity. The wine is a little spritzy, which isn√ït all that bad, although it may be better as an aperitif than a food wine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Perfumed and crisp, with bright lemon and tangy citrus flavors. It is a delicious, young, fruity and ready to drink."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Sumptuous on the nose with aromas of lychee, rose petals and honeycomb. On the palate, it's dry yet juicy with melon and stone fruit flavor. Enjoy now for its voluptuous exuberance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Made entirely with the native grape Bombino Nero, this informal light-bodied wine has subdued aromas of wild cherry and a hint of crushed herb. The aromas carry over to the √ºber-simple palate along with a hint of pink grapefruit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A lush, attractive young wine filled with the flavors of ripe blackberries, black currants, tar, chocolate, cedar and pepper, its tannins are hard and a little astringent. Give it a few years or serious decanting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aged in wood, this very fine wine shows sophisticated tannins, complex spice, black-plum fruits and a judicious shot of acidity. It is a fine wine, still young and showing a good potential for aging. Drink from 2029."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Lightly briny citrus aromas. Chunky palate that's acidic and driven, tropical with flavors of passion fruit and kiwi. A plump finish is slightly oily in feel and briny in flavor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Talk about an incredibly ripe wine; this deals prune, marzipan, tobacco and sandalwood aromas along with loads of blackberry and cassis. In the mouth, it's tannic like nails, with enormous blackberry and chocolate flavors that narrow down on a fast-charging but ultimately short finish. You can equate this to a rough and bumpy road that takes you to a nice vista. Drink through 2023."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Creamy, oaky and buttery, with a scour of acidity that feels out of place. The underlying flavors are of apricots and oranges. Pretty good, in a country style."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Vanilla wraps itself around cherry, cranberry and pomegranate to open with a ripe bang before this wine delves into darker tar notes and big tannins. Powerfully dense and concentrated, it maintains an herbal overtone that suggest further potential over time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"You'll find plenty of tart green gooseberries in this dry Sauvignon Blanc. Yet there are also ripe grapefruit, kiwi and papaya flavors. It's a refreshingly clean wine for drinking now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Couldn't get any riper, with an explosion of blackberries, cherries, currants, plums, and cola, not to mention plenty of toasty, caramelized oak. Trades complexity and subtlety for sheer power."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This refined Malagouzia starts with a fleshy peach and melon nose, followed by pronounced flavors of peach, citrus and spice on the palate. Balanced and pretty, the fruit tones linger on the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Boysenberry, cracked peppercorn and caramel frame the nose of this rich red. Although not particularly complex, lush flavors of berry juice and espresso on the palate prove rather tasty and enjoyable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Woodland berry, toast, sawdust, grilled herb and camphor are some of the aromas that emerge on this. On the rather slim palate, licorice, orange peel and rose add interest to fresh strawberry while assertive tannins provide the framework. It finishes on a slightly bitter note of dried sage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A blend of four grapes, this structured wine shows big black fruitiness along with fresh acidity. It's still young, bright with acidity and needs time to round out. Drink from 2027."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A rich red blend that opens with blackberry, rum cake, Indian spice, cola and ground clove. It combines intensity and complexity with a bold, opulent mouthfeel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This simple Extra Dry Prosecco opens with peach, nectarine, simple lines and a watery mouthfeel. The sparkler's momentum is achieved mostly by the creaminess of its bubbles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This full-bodied wine relies more on its rich texture and nutty, mineral flavors than on the usual citrus and herb notes, so it's rather thick in profile. It has the heft of a Chardonnay and savory, almond-like accents that are worth appreciating."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Full of spice, ripe toastiness and rich apple flavors, this structured wine has good potential. Lively acidity brings out the citrus and freshness of the wine. Drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This 10-acre estate dates from the 16th century. Today, it has produced a solidly structured wine with firm tannins and a dense textured character. The black fruits are firm with considerable intensity and backed with spice and acidity. Drink from 2024."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of prune, red berry, graphite and mint lead the nose. The palate delivers raw red cherry, black pepper, anise and sage alongside bright acidity and compact tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A bit too hot for complete balance, the result of high alcohol. Other than that, it's rich, full bodied and delicious in berry, cassis and oak flavors."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The bouquet deals some peach, custard and a slight hint of oak, while the palate runs racy, fresh and citrusy. If you like a fresher style with strong orange and tropical fruit flavors, this is your ticket."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Made using organically farmed fruit, this is a fresh, steady and youthful expression. It boasts simple lines, with loads of lemony freshness on the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Lightly textured and velvety in feel, Judson Hale's Yorkville Highlands Pinot Noir has a bigger fruit expression than many of its brethren from cooler parts of the nearby Anderson Valley, with ripe red fruit front and center and a big, slightly woody finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A blend of Grenache, Mourv√®dre and Petite Sirah all aged in neutral oak, it's jazzy and appealing with notes of blue fruit, raspberry, smoked meat and peppery spices showing good purity and richness. It's nowhere near as weighty as the labeled alcohol level might suggest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Tight and compact, this delivers tangy, spicy intensity that's packed around a solid core of red fruit. The midpalate is driven by sensations of cherry, cassis and blackberry, and the finish shows signs of smoky barbecue and roasted chestnut."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This rich and structured wine is packed with both ripe black fruits and concentrated tannins. It is a big wine, a fine representation of this appellation with its dense flavors and aging potential. The wine should be ready from 2029."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Barbecue and lusty stews are what this wine wants. It's dryish to sweet in raisin, blackberry jam, chocolate, beef jerky and spice flavors, and the tannins are big and tough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of forest floor, baked plum, clove and a balsamic whiff of eucalyptus lead the nose. The firmly structured palate offers fleshy wild cherry, raspberry, star anise, tobacco and nutmeg alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2022‚Äì2028."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This wine's red apple, flower and lees aromas lead to off-dry, leesy fruit flavors that seem a bit heavy and weighed down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Whiffs of lychee and pink grapefruit accent fresh florals on this slightly off-dry Gew√ºrztraminer. It's plush on the palate with juicy stone-fruit flavors, but also bright with lemony acidity. Finishes elegantly with a murmur of tea-leaf tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Spiced apple and light oak aromas are clean and attractive. This wine feels racy and pure, with good acidic kick. Flavors of nectarine and wood are compatible, while this barrel-fermented Viura (with 10% Malvasia) is solid on the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Lighter-than-usual color and plenty of red cherry, raspberry and turned earth aromas. It offers low-level fruit flavors and good balance of acidity versus ripeness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This ripe, crisp and intensely fruity wine does have a touch of tannin, inevitable with Cabernet Franc, but it is really all about red fruits and refreshing acidity. Drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A creamy, smooth wine, flavored with pears, even lychees and full, ripe Gr√ºner Veltliner. This shows the rich side of the grape, while still keeping its essential freshness. Typical pepper flavors come to finish. Glass stopper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Rusty in color, with aromas of compost and rotten leaves, this isn't cutting it. A drawing hard palate and burnt-out flavors that match the nose make this a hard road to navigate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Relatively soft with as much generous fruit as tannins. Some high-toast oak flavor needs to integrate, while showing great density and concentration. With power behind it, the wine will age seriously. Drink from 2023."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Basic, fresh, honest aromas of red-berry fruits and spice set up a wide, easygoing palate with cassis, blackberry and herbal flavors. Only on the finish does one detect some acidity and rawness. Overall this is a nice Cab for casual drinking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This Christian Roguenant wine, which translates to ‚ÄúRed Falcon,‚Äù offers a plump and inviting nose of black plum, cherry, cinnamon,and gingerbread aromas, with a touch of crushed slate. The palate tightens up remarkably, revealing gravel notes and dark berry fruit, proving minerally throughout the sip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Seamless, smoky, supple and seductive. Exotic sandalwood and Asian spices weave from the nose into the palate, wrapped around broad black cherry and blackberry fruit flavors. A darker streak of black olive and licorice runs into a finish replete with tannins that are tight and hint at stem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Shows weight, intense black-currant fruitiness and density from the high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Dark and brooding, it's likely to age for many years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Opens with aromas of toast, espresso, sunbaked earth and mature plum. The structured palate offers black cherries marinated in spirits, vanilla, toasted oak and coffee, while firm, fine-grained tannins provide the framework."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Blackberry and black cherry sauce aromas are given intrigue with tobacco leaf and sharp clove spice. Cinnamon stick and allspice shine on the very spicy palate, which is laid across a boysenberry backbone, with flecks of black pepper throughout."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Subtle and elegant, this opens with a smoky aroma that underscores delicate scents of orchard fruit, citrus and botanical herb. The aromas follow through to the linear palate along with a racy mineral vein. A note of cured meat closes the racy finish."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"This is an easy, fruit-forward wine that would pair well with family dinners and simple pasta dishes. Cherry, bramble, wet earth, pressed violets and light coffee tones characterize the nose and are exactly what you should look for in a no-fuss Chianti. Vibrant berry flavors are carried forward thanks to the wine's smooth structure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A strong, toasted, smoky aroma and charred oak flavors define this medium-bodied, rich-textured wine. Not exactly light on its feet, but fans of oak will appreciate the bold, toasty, buttery character."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"There aren't that many organic Proseccos out there, and this expression from La Jara is thin, crisp and refreshing. There is a pungent grassy note at the outset that needs a few minutes to disappear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Rich, if a little one-dimensional, this has flavors of creamy orange, yellow apricot, vanilla and buttered toast. It will appeal to fans of the forward style of Chardonnay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Earth and black tea meet forest floor notes in this dark, brooding and powerfully full-bodied wine. A touch of reduction accentuates the profuse oak, recalling clove and cardamom, as tingling acidity vies for attention and integration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This Bordeaux-style blend, one of four from this tiny winery, is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon. The somewhat thin cranberry and raspberry fruit, high in acid, is not quite substantial enough to completely shed its candied character."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"With a notable orange tinge, the aromas offer notes of flowers and orange peel, seeming to show a touch of oxygen exposure. It drinks off dry, with abundant orange-rind and smoke flavors."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Very tart, with a deep, tannic, earthy mineral streak.

{"prompt":"","completion":"Zesty lime and green fern aromas rise from the glass. The palate merely adds a little green pear fruit to this refreshing and enlivening combo of utter cleanness and verve. The linearity and drive make this moreish, very exciting and totally lip-smacking. Echoes of pepper on the aftertaste make it even more intriguing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Creamy notes of pear still carry a hint of flinty smoke, but the pear notes rise with purity. The bright freshness of pure lemon lifts everything and makes for purity, ease, refreshment and blithe joy."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Ripe and plump blackberries shine through in a showcase of fruit purity, lifted by dried fennel, hot black gravel, peppercorns, toasted sesame and soy. There is tremendous structure and acidity on the sip, with black pepper and black-sesame nuance plus juicy boysenberry character to the mid-palate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Heavy wafts of petrol and oak dominate at first in this wine, before some air and some swirling in the glass reveal more lifted aromas and flavors of lemon candy, green apple and apple tart.
