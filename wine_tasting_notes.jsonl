{"prompt":"","completion":"This is very intense on the nose with blue fruit, cool stones, brambleberries and blackberries. Wet earth, too. Full-bodied and extremely dense and powerful with a super center palate of fruit and ripe yet compact tannins. Lightly chewy and expressive. Superb transparency and integration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Earthy aromas of bark, sand, truffles, graphite, rust, terracotta and sandalwood rise up from the deep with Burgundian poise; fruitier orange zest and preserved lemons glimmer in their wake, while riper incense and tar lurk in this dense forest of aromas. Physics itself gives way as the line between reduction and oxidation is blurred. There’s such richness to the center palate, but the fruit there is vivacious and elegant, swaddled in robust but generous tannins that breach the outermost reaches of the mouth. The finish is hauntingly long, the after effects of the acidity unworldly. This is certainly in a quiet, reserved stage of evolution, and will need time to fully mature in bottle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The most structured Prado Enea ever. A reduced center palate that is so compact with dark fruit, dark mushrooms and cedary spice. Full body. Wonderfully polished tannins and a long, long finish. Electric acidity. Muscular and well toned. The is a new classic that reminds me of great Spanish wines from the 1940s and 1950s."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is big and powerful, without being ripe and heavy. So much apple, stone, and hints of toffee. Aromatic. Full-bodied, layered and framed with phenolic tension and a great finish. Muscular and agile at the same time. One of the best I have tasted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Very pure slate here, this is something unique. The elevated, steep and stony site has such strength of character, delivered with such purity. Gun smoke, gunflint and very fine fragrance with a streak of fresh lemons. So fine. The palate has a super fine and elegant feel, floating ballet-like over the palate. Such elegance and power. The finesse and length is really ethereal. Yellow-grapefruit juice and pith here. Wildly succulent at the long, salty finish. What a thrilling wine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This has such freshness at between nine and ten years of age. It delivers a very rich, blue-fruit core with spiced earth and light, leathery nuances. The palate has composed and compact tannins and a slinky and rich, powerful array of blueberries and a long, juicy, succulent and vibrant finish. Shows just how well Rippon pinots age. This is just getting started! Maturation release."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The aromas here are so spellbinding with shitake mushrooms, wet earth and moss, as well as tree bark and, finally, dark fruit. The palate is incredible as it builds and grows with full body, but always tight and reserved. It shows so much depth and complexity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The purity of fruit on the nose is perfection with cherries, crushed raspberries, mineral, pumice and citrus fruit. Dust, too. Full body. Powerful, chewy tannins. So long and muscular, yet polished and formed. Most structured Brunello I have ever had from here. A wine for decades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Great aromas of dried strawberries and fresh flowers, such as lavender. Full-bodied yet very tight and focused. Impressive tannic structure, but refined and polished. Lightly chewy. Finishes tight and refined."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"The aromas of blackberry leaves and iodine are wild and exotic here with mussel shells and earth underneath. Full-bodied, tight and chewy with powerful tannins that show muscle. It’s structured and powerful. Dense and very, very deep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Exquisite wine with such freshness and complexity, offering abundant red plums, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries with a wealth of fragrance and gently spicy oak – they used a one-year-old vat for this wine – violets and blood oranges. Profound aromatic purity. The palate is elegant and refined and extremely well focused, so layered and plush and very, very long with ribbon-like tannins. Intensity with elegance and discreet power. A trifecta of perfection, this is the third 100-point rating in as many releases."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A slightly more luxurious nature to the 2008 than the great 2007. Full-bodied with a lovely framework of acidity and dry fruit, such as apples, pears and peaches. Opulent. Dense and muscular. Yet, it’s balanced and harmonious. Line of acidity at the end. One for the cellar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a huge and impressive wine, but somehow graceful and subtle. It packs an eclectic array of brambleberry compote, violet essence, eucalyptus, oyster shell, pure iodine, vanilla, resin, tar, cassis, plum liqueur and hot stones. You can only stand back in awe as one shade of fruit appears after the next and a barrage of tannin coats your mouth. Yet, this is gentle, agile and flowing. Nevertheless, its main attraction remains its unashamed, monumental power and muscularity. A haunting wine that sends chills down your spine."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"The intensity of fruit is staggering here, as this stacks up dried peaches, dried strawberries, red licorice, red-plum compote and glazed red cherries, in rapid succession. There’s a breadth of flavor to the palate that will take your breath away; muscular tannins draw in deeply set cherries, melding it together in a glistening coating of acidity, which only helps to carry it longer still. The finish is nearly endless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Fantastic aromas of blackcurrants and other dark fruit with crushed stone, iron and oysters, following through to a full body that shows incredible energy and depth, offering ripe yet fresh fruit, together with bright herbs and earth. Precision and balance of the intensity of the vintage. Layered."}

Very grainy and refined on the palate with a real kick from the orange-rind undertones that permeate the entire palate. Tiptoes like a tightrope walker between power and finesse and executes its mission nearly to perfection."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is quite a remarkable wine that prompts a vision of looking out over a vast orchard of glistening red cherries and red plums, weighing down gnarled, bark-scented trunks. Beneath the fragant canopy, luscious clay soils are interspersed with ferrous deposits and fresh grass stirs. Viscous layers of pure red fruit pour into the palate, soaking the mouth from top to bottom in profuse layers of spices and orange zest. The tannins have the muscle of a bodybuilder, but the acidity dances through the mouth like a ballerina. The finish is limitless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a wonderful syrah with superb density and, at the same time, finesse and a quality of tannin that is most impressive. Raspberries, dark berries and licorice with some violet aromas, following through to a full body with soft, creamy tannins. Superb texture."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is really focused and refined with fantastic dried flowers and dark berries. Dried-lavender and mint undertones. Medium-to full-bodied with refined and polished tannins that are all together and so focused. Really integrated and melted together on the palate. Compact and very linear. Please give this two or three years to come completely together, but it’s already breathtaking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Complex aromas of tar, wet earth, dark berry and flowers follow through to a full body, medium sweet and amazing compacted concentration. Vertical and so deep. It goes on for minutes. Truly excellent."}

Magnificently articulate pinot that is also just utterly delicious and whose style is driven very much by site and soil, both cleverly interpreted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a splendid Brunello, showing extraordinary purity of sangiovese character. Cherry and floral aromas and flavors. Full-bodied with incredibly integrated tannins that seem like they are not there. But they are and are comprehensive on the palate. Great depth and agility. Just floats on the palate. Magic carpet. Drinkable, to enjoy the magic, but needs three or four years to come around."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Impressive roses and finely ground spices with a bright red-cherry core, as well as a fresh wild-herb thread. The sense of focus and purity here is stunning.

Full-bodied with tannins that roll off the palate and flow to the finish. Fine, velvety texture. Lasts for minutes. Already so attractive, but be patient."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The minerality here is astonishing — the citrus fruit is so pure and so powerful that it prickles the inside of your nose like a pickle or heady spice. Crushed bones, wet stones and flint are dialed up nearly to perfection. Talk about vertical? No. Talk about a skyscraper! It has so much energy it nearly explodes, the acidity rising up to infinity and beyond. Staggering freshness and length. If this doesn’t blow you away, nothing will."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This has discreet aromatics, showing very fine stones and yellow grapefruit with a delicate, lemon-blossom perfume. The palate has a scintillatingly intense and focused feel with laser-guided acidity, driving a very long, pure and thrilling palate. Yellow citrus fruit abounds. Such precision is really special and the concentration in 2018 is immense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Incredible aromas of blackberries, hot stones, wet earth and flowers. Full-bodied, it floats across the palate with ultra-fine tannins that melt into the wine. Superb, long finish of subtle fruit and terroir-defined subtleties. Try in 2022, but already a dream to taste."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The concentration and largesse of the 2016 Pichon Baron is apparent from the get-go with incredibly alluring, ripe and expansive fruit aromas in the blackberry, dark-cherry, mulberry and plum zone. Espresso and cedar, as well as a slate-like, stony mineral edge add complexity. The palate has incredible depth, drive and detail. Fine and plush tannins stretch the palate in every direction. So fresh and vivacious, this is the greatest Pichon Baron since 1989 and has a long future."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The aromas of blackberries, cedar, sandalwood and black tea are compelling. Black olives. Rosemary and sage undertones. Full-bodied, rich and powerful Seña with impressive and powerful tannins, yet harmony and balance. Fruit-forward. Lightly chewy. Fresh and energetic wine in a hot year. Broad-shouldered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Breathtaking. Exceptional integration of super ripe blackberries and the very finest oak. The tannins build up beautifully, forming wave upon wave as the wine flows across the palate. Then the wave breaks on your palate and shoots way out at the finish, so that you wonder where it will end and normal life begin again. Needs time to soften, but this is so, so good. Give it two or three years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Amazing, pure cherries, plums and flowers, as well as crushed stones. It jumps out of the glass. Full body, powerful tannins and a freshness and roundness to it. Lightly salty on the finish. Great structure with finesse."}

There’s a fabulous saltiness and oyster-shell undertone to the fruit. Unique. Drinkable already, but this year there’s the structure to last decades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The light rust and amber color is enticing. Aromas of dried rose petals, cinnamon and nutmeg. Hints of dried meat, smoke and sage. Full body and compact, creamy texture. So fine and delicious. Great, subtle and complex flavors. More like a lightly aged, premier cru Volnay, but with the magic of Champagne."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a selection of the estate-vineyard pinot noir that is planted on a solid sheet of parent rock. The nose is ebulliently fruited with intense, poached berries, as well as a pastry-like edge, flowers and stones, serving up what proves to be a deceptively charming, seductive impression. The palate arrives as a layered array of sheet-like tannins in very vertical form; the flavors have to climb up and across to be tasted and they are pristine, fresh cherries and red plums when they arrive. As the flavors abate, the stony, noble tannins remain like a rock face, just begging to be climbed again. Sheer brilliance. Hold for more than a decade, if you can."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is muscular yet so well defined and toned. Full-bodied with deep and dense fruit on the palate, yet powerful and rich at the same time. So much sandalwood and blackberry character. Chewy and rich at the finish. This is a warm and generous wine, but the alcohol is just over 13 degrees. Not that high. Love the finish. Extravagant. Magical."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Super aromas of blackberries, blackcurrants and blueberries. Hints of fresh herbs and tobacco. Iron and ink. Full-bodied, very tight and powerful, yet not too heavy. Lightly chewy and polished. So much nerve and intensity. Super length and depth. Drink after 2025, but a joy to taste now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The aromas of violets and dark berries with licorice and sweet black tea are so attractive. What really impresses is the sweet fruit in the dense middle palate. So attractive. At the same time, there’s plenty of plush and ripe tannins that give the wine form and brightness. And it still remains bright on the finish, as the tannins roll on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Blackberries, blueberries, raspberry kir, sweet tobacco and black truffle. Full bodied with chewy tannins and superb texture and length. Extremely poised and powerful. Finishes with so much fresh leather and blueberries."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a phenomenal Champagne of such purity. It delivers immense power with such refinement. There’s a very precise feel with a super fine, sliced-brioche nose and white-peach, fine-lemon and chalky-mineral notes. So fresh. There’s such intensity, focus and delicacy to the palate. So focused and so detailed with seamless, fluid, ripe-chardonnay flavor and layers of savory baked biscuits, building on the finish. Wonderfully complete structure and texture. The power here is considerable and the acidity drive is simply wild."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The pure fruit and juicy tannins are so succulent and enticing. Full body and soft, silky tannins. Complete. Everything is where it should be.

{"prompt":"","completion":"The aromas here are amazing: crushed blueberries and raspberries with wet earth and dried flower. Orange blossom. Tar and stone. Full body, very sweet but the powerful and fine-grained tannins balance the wine out. Tannins and fruit envelop your mouth with each sip. Great potential. Single vineyard port."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is an old-vine Port with two-thirds coming from ancient ones. Bark, black tea, crushed grapes and mahogany. Big and grippy. Old, traditional styled Port with incredible depth and power. Big yet polished tannins. This is foot-trodden. Co-fermented. Real deal."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"This pinot has an x-factor that sets it apart. There’s an almost peppery edge to the violet, blueberry and red-cherry nose with sappy and earthy elements, as well as roasted game and fragrant baking spices. The palate has a very plush, attractive and fresh array of vibrant and detailed pinot fruit on offer. Long and precise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a mind-boggling syrah that has a nose more reminiscent of a white than a red and shows ethereal aromas of peaches, persimmon, milk chocolate, barley and Chinese plums. So polished and effortless on the palate, floating between layer upon layer of violets and lavender and then on to juicy but muscular tannins that coat the palate and keep the fruit long and nearly endless. Drink now or hold for a long time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Speechless here. I thought the 2015 was already perfect but this is perfect, too. But in a different way. It is so structured and multidimensional. Full-bodied, powerful and intense with incredible tannin backbone and depth. The dark-berry, wet-earth, oyster-shell and mushroom flavors are phenomenal. Give it four or five years to come together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Very complex and alluringly spicy aromas that bubble in and out of the nose, together with fresh tobacco, raspberries and iodine, moving into blackcurrants, blackberries and a gently gravely, stony edge. The palate has incredible polish that is a foil for the intense power and concentration of this wine. The texture is flawless, building smoothly with fine-grained and focused tannins that sustain a long, fresh finish. The new 1986, which was a legend. This is probably better."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A selection of old vines in Morstein. Super refined, steely notes of flint and oyster shell with fragrant spices and delicate, white wild flowers. Sweet, freshly rolled pastry, fine lemons and grapefruit, too. This is so complex and quite cryptic for now. Impenetrable. The palate also delivers a very complex impression. Very layered and finely detailed with acidity that guides a stream-like fusion of stone-fruit and yellow-citrus flavors. Very compressed, very dense and very complete."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Fresh blueberries and brambleberries take center stage, which is striking for a wine of this age. There are also lots of roasted herbs, such as sage, not to mention floral elements, including lavender and dried violets. Then come cedar, sandalwood and tar. The tannins are incredibly round and soft, without the slightest hint of anything dry. This is among the most elegant of Riojas, where the acidity is wonderfully pronounced and cuts right through any touch of dried fruit. Long and powerful, yet subtle on the finish. Drink now, or hold for a very long time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The complexity of this is something very special with dark berries, hot stone, iodine, and oyster shells. Full-bodied, very tight and polished with creamy tannins that envelop your palate, caressing every inch. Deep and dark fruit and wet earth at the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"An exceptional chardonnay with a wealth of very fresh and slightly flinty lemon, grapefruit, white-peach and grilled-hazelnut aromas. The palate has such grace and well-defined, pure lemon and grapefruit, as well as white and yellow peaches. The toasted-hazelnut afterglow is stunning. Hints of praline, too. So elegant, pristine and pure. Exceptional."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is always an entrancing Gran Selezione and the 2016 shows dried raspberries, boysenberries, vanilla and brambleberries. Full-bodied and tightly wound with eye-catching minerality. The acidity sharpens out the exuberant red fruit perfectly. Incredible length and drinkability. Is this better even than the great 2015? I think so. From organically grown grapes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"OMG. This grenache is unworldly. Not only does this pack just about as much black fruit within the nose as you could possibly imagine, but there is nuance upon nuance of earthy complexity. Dried orange rind, pine needles, iodine, violets, blood orange, black pepper, bark, forest floor and oyster shell. So velvety on the palate, which is caressed by tannins of pure silk and acidity of pure steel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Really pristine fruit aromas here with such pure, ripe red cherries and roses, as well as gently earthy and spicy nuances. Very fresh, precisely ripe and a pinot you can sit and just breathe in for days. The palate has a velvety layer that few others manage to find; silky at the core, succulent in the center and delivering such vibrant, red-cherry flavors in a long, pristine and fresh, red-cherry finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The purity of fruit to this is really something else. I am not sure I have tasted a young Spanish wine with such purity. The crushed-blackberry, violet and sandalwood aromas with dried black tea are so enticing. They really catch your mind. The fruit and tannin texture to this is impeccable, as it just folds together on the palate and delivers a perfect balance of fruit and texture. Dances on your palate. You have to drink it now. But it will age forever."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Wonderfully complex aromas of tobacco flowers, violets, blueberries and black olives. Full-bodied, dense and very polished with fine, chewy tannins and a flavorful finish. The tannins are right and solid. This needs two or three years to soften, but shows great promise, as always."}

This is an exceptional Clos."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"From a one-hectare parcel of pinot noir, planted in 1964.

The palate has intensity that is truly bracing and delivers such power and length. Exceptional!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a profound wine, offering really striking depth of aromas and flavors with a resonance that really stops you still. Dark stones, ripe dark plums and blackberries, licorice, sarsaparilla, orange peel and cloves with still more spices floating in the midst. The palate has such perfectly captured intensity of ripe dark plums and blackberries that it is seemingly impenetrable for now. Yet, the detail is all here. It builds and fills the palate completely with ripe, espresso-laced blackberries, black cherries and dark plums and delivers such freshness at the finish. This is a triumph and up there with the greatest La Landonne releases."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Spectacular aromas of crushed berries, such as blueberries and raspberries. Fresh flowers with hints of sandalwood. Exotic. Saturated palate of so much fruit, yet remains agile and energetic. Great length and texture. Fills your mouth. This needs time, but a classic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"OMG. Blackberries, blackcurrants, blueberries, licorice, and spearmint. Mint, too. Full-bodied, so tight and poised with super tightness and focus. Phenomenal depth and composure. This shows real Napa character that harkens back to the Heitz Martha’s 1968. Benchmark to consider."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is phenomenal. The precision and brightness is amazing with ultra-fine tannins that are so polished and so beautiful. Full to medium body and fabulous fruit. Wonderful length and beauty. The purity and balance is incredible. Dark berries, walnuts and dark chocolate. Makes you want to drink it now, but be patient and revel in the greatness."}

Aromas of orange and lemon peel to start, then graphite, blackberries, plum paste, black cherries, boundless sweet oak spice, fresh cedar, tar, mahogany, roasted coffee and chocolate - the list goes on. Such complexity. Classic Grange, offering such deep, dark intensity. The palate has immense richness and depth with a super succulent and very long, fleshy, deeply weighted array of dense, velvet-wrapped tannins that run so long.

{"prompt":"","completion":"It’s the fruit tea and hibiscus that really lifts this, not to mention the roasted herbs that lurk beneath the surface. But there’s no shortage of dried fruit either, whether it be dried cherries, dried plums or Christmas cake. It’s a real mouth-coater, showing sheer elegance in a bottle, encapsulated in the tannins that weave an ornate tapestry, hung between every corner of the palate. Full-bodied and very, very long. Best ever?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is always an eye-catching white, but 2017 is on another level. It takes you on a journey through a field of buttercups and edelweiss, before moving through riper notes of mangoes and apricot pastries. Candied citrus is always lingering in the background. The palate is where it really goes into another realm, though, opening through agile mineral and stoney nuances into denser tropical and stone fruit and then onto rich, structured phenolics. The salty finish is seemingly endless with acidity that sabers through the lightly oxidative aftertaste with subtle reduction. What a wine! This has to be the best ever from here — by a mile."}

Integrated hints of bark and sandalwood. Full-bodied with strapping tannins and muscular, imposing structure and power. Notwithstanding, everything is in striking balance and delivered with remarkable precision and grit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Extremely perfumed aromas of tangerines and violets with blackberries, cassis and wet earth. Full-bodied yet reserved and very precise with amazing purity of currants, blackberries and lightly burnt oranges. Superb finish of firm yet extremely polished tannins. Perfect. Hard not to drink now, but better after four to five years."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Let go of the narrow human world and fall into this expansive dry riesling that busts out of the conventional framework for the grape variety. And that's what makes it so difficult to describe. However, there is certainly more yellow fruit (mirabelle, but also a hint of pineapple) than white (some ripe pear) and the minerality is huge, yet totally precise and delicate. The finish really doesn't want to stop!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Ravishing bouquet of a thousand golden fruits and a staggering interplay of diamond-bright acidity and great succulence. Then, just when you think you've processed all that, along comes a monster wave of minerality, which sweeps you off your feet. But you land on the beach, deliriously happy."}

The palate has a powerful, layered, long and symphonic feel and is packed with rich red-plum and black-cherry flavor. Such attractive freshness and majestically long, smoothly wrapped tannins. The finish is so long, seamless, profoundly pure and perfectly balanced. Freshens into a lasting, plum-stone finish. This is incredible, the best Wendouree shiraz of the modern era. A single parcel of 1919 Eastern Vineyard plantings. Already quite approachable but"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The purity of fruit here is so stunning with blackberry, black-cherry, black-truffle and floral aromas, as well as orange peel.

{"prompt":"","completion":"This is really muscular and really powerful. It is amazing. Full-bodied, yet tight and super structured with incredible power and super toned tannins. It goes on for minutes. The greatest Barbaresco ever from here? I love the strength with fruit finesse. I don’t remember tasting a young Asili like this. Give this a lot of time to come together. One for the cellar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Wow. This is archetypal Barolo with a solid cylinder of polished tannins running through the center of the wine from start to finish.

This is breathtakingly pure, yet complex and drinkable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"One of the wines of this challenging vintage in Alsace, this is a masterpiece of concentrated minerality, but also has a seductive, kaleidoscopic array of yellow and exotic-fruit aromas (most obviously puréed peach).

From the estate’s oldest vines on the granitic Grand Cru Schlossberg."}

Aromas of fresh redcurrants, red and violet flowers, subtle spice, fresh earth, paper bark, fresh-picked thyme and sage, red berries and some cedary notes. The palate is stunning and has a brand of elegance with power that is found in only the greatest wines. Pristine mulberries, red plums, blueberries and red cherries sail through layers of fine tannin, into an unwaveringly long and vibrant finish. An exceptionally concentrated and convincing Diana Madeline release, this is one of their finest. Delicious now, but his will bloom from 2028."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a great edition of this standard bearer for elegant Yarra Valley claret. The nose is detailed and fresh with a central theme of red and dark berries, cedar, cocoa powder, violet-like florals and light leafy notes.

A great Armagh for sure.and drink over the following two decades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A significant vintage for Hill of Grace, as the last 2015 red to leave the Henschke cellar, and a wine that delivers on every ounce of its promise and then some. The nose is so complex and fragrant with trademark brown spices taking center stage, amid light espresso, sage leaves, blackberries, cinnamon, anise, orange peel, ripe dark plums, pepper, gun smoke and a gentle, dried-rose edge. The palate has such impressive layers of fine tannin that make an instantly seamless, powerful and focused impression. It has architectural style with clean lines that build and ascend out of the finish. Long, spiced blackberries and dark plums are extruded in formation with such finesse and power. The acidity holds a torch to the rich, ripe plums and blackberries, illuminating freshness at the finish. A wine that will develop in a very consistent manner and likely to be at its best some 20 years from now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Wow. Blackberries, lead pencil, dried flowers, black olives and purple fruit. Full body and super polished and refined tannins. Creamy and well defined. So polished. Nutmeg, clove and other dried spices. It goes on for minutes. Superb."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"So deep, yet so subtle, this is a Rheingau masterpiece that's as deep as a fjord.

And then you fall into a seductive black hole at the very long, cool and dark finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The deepest waters are the most mysterious, because you look ever further down and never know what you're going to discover another five fathoms deeper. And just so, this beautiful riesling has seductive fruit that drags you into an abyss of beauty and joy. What stunning texture, and what a long, refined finish."}

Astonishing interplay of intense, herbal and mineral notes and tart, exotic-fruit flavors through the super long finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Super white with dried-apple, peach, stone and mineral aromas and flavors. It’s full-bodied with layers of really complex, ripe fruit and bright acidity. Undertones of cream and nougat. Seamless texture. Rioja’s answer to grand cru Burgundy. From organically grown grapes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A tight, linear red with plums, chocolate and walnuts and some forest-floor and porcini mushroom undertones. Complex and aromatic. Full-bodied with dense, chewy tannins that are intense and powerful. Flavorful and long. Opulent. Don’t drink before 2024."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a wine with fantastic dark fruit with subtle nutmeg and hints of Spanish cedar. Lead pencil and slate, too. Full-bodied, yet so refined and polished. It’s endless on the finish. Needs two or three years to come together."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a great Yquem, delivering thrilling purity and intensity. The nose offers intense aromas of fresh and dried apricot and peach pastry, as well as freshly baked creme brulee, candied and fresh orange and kumquat. Some marmalade, too. Smooth, glossy texture with flavors of grilled orange, dried apricot and an exceptionally long finish with a powerful, driving push to the end. A flicker of toasty-oak influence arrives late, but this wine has completely consumed the oak. The 2017 Yquem is a very powerful wine from a very rich and exceptional vintage. The acidity has a big hand in balancing the richness. Pithy finish. The phenolics deliver some great depth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Maybe I'm amazed! In spite of the density and concentration, this retains the light-footed and filigree character that are typical for this great vineyard site. A cornucopia of dried stone and tropical fruit, but also spices, dried herbs, a whiff of licorice and much else besides. Only just beginning to show what it's made of!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"At first, a biscuity note that reminds me of Champagne, but then a delicate and cool, peachy aroma comes through. I wanted to write that this has stunning concentration and brilliance, but actually it’s just like a laser beam that shoots across your palate, leaving you stunned and delighted. Enormous mineral freshness. From organically grown grapes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This pure cabernet sauvignon is the real deal with redcurrant and terracotta character on both the nose and palate. It’s full-bodied, yet really reserved and ultra-refined.

Incredible triumph for the vintage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A creamy and tightly wound red with crushed berries and flowers, as well as minerals and stones.

Deeply complex, intense aromas of fresh dark cherries, orange-peel and violets, as well as blueberries and a subtle, earthy edge. Wet stones here, too. The palate is so very silky and has a plush, vibrant and fluid texture with seamless delivery of ripe red and dark-cherry flavor in supple and silky mode. This is very open and drinkable. Very complete and long."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is really powerful and tightly structured with super depth and compression of fruit on the palate and some phenolic tension. This is made in concrete eggs and large casks. Purity is the word. but already superb."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a selection of the estate-vineyard pinot noir that is planted on a solid sheet of parent rock. It has an air of restraint from the first impression of crushed roses and violets with some sappy, fresh and attractive leaves and succulent plant notes and plenty of finely fragrant spices, cocoa, blueberry and dried dark cherry. The palate has a very smooth-honed tannin texture with cherry-pip flavor and a very silky, polished mouth feel. The grain of tannin is super tight and lustrous. The core of this intense tannin creates a sensation of enlivened tension that sets this wine apart, not only in the Antica Terra family, but from the vast majority of wines per se. It is so expressive, within a focused spectrum of characters, and has such energy and presence. A striking expression of pinot noir."}

Very concentrated, yet cool and focused, with a very precise interplay of tangerine fruit, wet-stone minerality and a hint of oak that echoes down the valleys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Very perfumed and aromatic with blackcurrant, sweet-tobacco and Spanish-cedar character. Full-bodied with ultra fine tannins that build on the palate and take the fruit and other flavors to an endless finish. More refined than the perfect 2018 and almost as compelling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This shows incredible depth of fruit with strawberry, cherry and phenolics. Full-bodied and layered with an incredible, three-dimensional element to the wine. This is so transparent and dynamic with dark fruit, yet it remains vivid and bright. Refined and precise, it goes on and on. Really savory, fresh and incredibly pinot-noir-like. What a wine. 13 years of maturation in the bottle. So drinkable now, but it will age for many years ahead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Extremely perfumed and beautiful with ripe strawberries and citrus fruit, as well as aromatic flowers. Full-bodied with plenty of fruit and creamy, chewy tannins that are polished and very impressive. Long and linear. One of the best of this bottling. Drink after 2023, but already a gorgeous bottle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"What a stunningly fresh nose for a five-year-old Alsace dry riesling. Vibrant nose of fresh pineapple with a whole garden of fresh-herb aromas. Rich and concentrated, but also cool and delicate at the front, then comes stunning, racy power that drives across the palate with great mineral energy. Doesn’t want to stop at the finish. From organically grown grapes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Extraordinary aromas of white peaches, apricots, vanilla and flowers. Full-bodied and very sweet with so much sweet and dried fruit, such as apricots and tangerines, yet it maintains citrusy freshness and texture, with a long, very sweet finish. Always energetic and vivid. Great length to this. It’s a sweet wine to drink when young, to marvel over the intensity and verve, yet also one to age for decades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Extremely aromatic with strawberries, flowers, and stones, following through to a full body with layers of fruit and round tannins that go on and on. Rich and opulent, yet polished and toned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Spicy and earthy notes of ginseng, dried pineapple, candied citrus, fig and toffee apple. The sweetness is balanced and complemented by earthy, complex layers. Lots of spicy botrytis character. Extremely long. Complex and thought-provoking with so much dried-fruit and spicy flavor at the end. Dense and tight, yet agile. Delicious now, but if you give it another five or six years, you will see even more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This ripe wine with its touches of vanilla as well as yellow fruits and acidity has a lightly honeyed character typical of the vintage. Ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Lush aromas of black cherry, vanilla, kola nut and blackberry fudge pack lots of action into this bottling. The palate confirms the complexity, with blueberry and black cherry backed by pipe tobacco, dried marjoram and a pencil lead-driven structure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Meaty, leathery and spicy smelling, which can be typical for the variety. The palate is a bit shrill and acidic, while narrow flavors of red berries, herbs and minty green settle on a lightly herbal finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"An immediately approachable wine with aromas of smoke, crushed stone and dark plum, this is a soft, supple example of its appellation. A bit of caramel emerges on the finish, where it coexists with mixed berry fruit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Under ripe fruit seems more sour than anything. Some bitter, stemmy flavors creep into the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Layered aromas of blackberry, cassis, leather and dried cheese are inviting. Jammy and friendly in the mouth. Candied almost syrupy flavors of blackberry and black cherry finish dense and chocolaty, with modest acidity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Made in a lighter style, this Pinot comes from the cooler Napa side of the Carneros. It's light- to medium-bodied and dry, with a silky texture and pleasant flavors of cherries, exotic dusty spices and sandalwood. Elegant and moderate in alcohol, it's a wine to drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of quince and lemon see the stage for flavors of green apple, quince and geranium leaf. Floral notes overpower fruit flavors, and the finish is slightly stiff for a white wine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This aromatic wine offers notes of apricot, flowers and jasmine. It drinks off dry with abundant stone fruit flavors."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This brawny, one-dimensional red offers flavors of raisin, dark spice, a note of powdered sage and the heat of evident alcohol. Bracing, grainy tannins leave a sharp finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Great structure, great acidity, with the ripe fruit pierced with acidity. The tannins are hugely powerful and dry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Creamy, concentrated waves of vanilla and cherry, with just a hint of almond, open the way to high-toned structure and integrated tannin and oak, finishing balanced and bright."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This leads with mocha, herb and leather aromas. The palate is still tight and closed but offers red berry, clove and sage hints with some air. Clenched tannins grip the close."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Barrel notes of vanilla and spice take the lead in this aromatically brooding wine, followed by dried herbs and dark fruit. The flavors are pitch black, coating the palate from end to end with layers of fruit, tannins that go the distance and a graphite-filled finish that lingers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Located on high ground to the east of Cahors, this estate was replanted in the 1980s at a high density. Rich, smooth and dense, this shows concentrated ripe plum and juicy blackberry flavors and, above all, firm tannins. Wood aging has smoothed the rough edges."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a 100% varietal wine sourced from the coveted Oakville Ranch Vineyard on the eastern edge of the appellation. Cedar, herb, meat and soy mingle around a full-bodied weight softened by the wine's classic edge, length and breadth of black fruit and vanilla oak."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Dark garnet in color, this wine proffers a bouquet of cassis, dark plum and lavender. There is a nice combination of fruit and savory flavors, notably black cherry, strawberry, espresso, smoked meat and oregano. Soft almost sneaky tannins appear on the palate and then retreat just in time for a vivid finish sprinkled with just a touch of Mediterranean herbs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a fine effort; the fruit smacks of cut pear, pineapple and light tropical flavors. It's textural and tangy, with a pleasing citrus skin finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"It's hard to get very excited about this wine because it's so average and common. It smells weakly of lemons, and the citrus flavors are watery and thin. It's dry and although there's some good acidity, it feels flat in the mouth. That says it all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A sweet, medium-bodied style of Pinot Gris, with honeyed flavors of apple, pear and pineapple. Despite the sweetness, the finish is nicely balanced, with a lush texture. Even prettier is the wine's pale copper hue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this is a wine that imparts great intensity and a wide range of aromas including red fruit, dried mint leaf, root beer and white truffle. It boasts a beautiful color, firm tannins and smoky flavors in the mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Intensely ripe black cherries and plums lend heft to this rich, boldly textured Pinot Noir. It's a nuanced wine, accented by hints of dried herbs, violets and a crush of mineral tones that elongate the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This elegantly structured wine is a wonderful expression of Sauvignon's serious side, offering delicate yellow stone fruit, wildflower and toasted nut scents. On the polished, full-bodied palate, a hint of nectarine backs up creamy yellow peach fruit while fresh acidity lends balance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A wine that combines richness with a great structure. It is ripe, smoky, the red fruits rich and concentrated. A wine that is packed with juicy fruit and also with a good aging potential."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a balanced blend of the three major Champagne grapes from a producer in the Marne Valley. With its high proportion of Pinot Meunier, it has a soft and rich character. Attractive and fruity, it's ready to drink."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Subdued aromas of strawberry, rose petal and toast come together in the glass. The palate offers bright red berry and a hint of green tea alongside polished tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a full-bodied yet succulent, supple wine, loaded with dark fruit. Black cherries and plums hint at sur-maturité, framed in a soft wrap of baking spices and mocha."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Lemon-scented Mirabelle notes hover on the nose and turn into fully fledged, ripe plum on the palate where the seam of fresh, enlivening and brightening acidity sets a lively theme. The body is light, the finish is dry and the overall impression is one of light-footed playfulness and ease. You might almost forget to notice the more textured, structured core which underlies all this and will allow it to age beautifully. Drink now through 2025."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A wood-aged white with light toast character to complement the creamy pear and melon flavors. It is full in the mouth, rounded and soft."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Entirely sourced from this Sangiacomo family-farmed vineyard, which is planted entirely to the Old Wente clone, this wine offers fleshy and tropical juiciness and texture. Aged in French oak, the vast majority of it neutral, the wine lets the fruit and acidity speak for themselves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Hard and showing an herbal edge, this single-vineyard Merlot will require some further bottle age and\/or decanting. It drinks more like a Cabernet than a Merlot, with a green slant to the tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of violet, dark-skinned berry and baking spice are the highlights. On the bright, juicy palate, soft velvety tannins frame mature black cherry, blackberry and a hint of cocoa."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a most affordable Pinot, a blend of multiple clones and vineyards, and it's a gem. Full and fruity from the moment you pull the cork, it hits you with flavors of ripe strawberry, blackberry and black cherry, a big mouthful of lush fruit flavor. The finish brings on hints of truffle, licorice and dark chocolate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Peach and flower aromas are pleasant and light. This is also delicate and airy across the palate, while sweet, candied flavors of lychee, apple and green melon finish sweet, on the verge of cloying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Light plum and raspberry aromas include notes of animal and latex. This lightweight Garnacha has a monotone mouthfeel, while hollow simple berry flavors finish with acidic tang."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This Sauvignon Blanc is neutral on the nose except for a smack of lime. Mild on the palate, this tastes of briny, salty citrus fruits and peels. A fresh finish confirms that this is straightforward but enjoyable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This rich wine is full and has a good balance of acidity and fruit. The lightly mineral texture gives bite and crispness. It is still a young, tight wine needing another few months. Drink from 2026."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Light and lively, this has crisp apple and citrus aromas, nicely tangy fruit flavors and relatively light body. It feels juicy but lean rather than rich, in a refreshing alternative style."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This wine shows both beautifully ripe fruit and a tight mineral streak that will keep it on the straight and narrow. It does need to age and the wine will be best from 2028."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"California Viognier doesn't get any richer than this. Although it's dry, it has high-alcohol glycerine that gives a honeyed sweetness to the flamboyant pineapple, nectarine, peach and lemon cream flavors. Drink this unctuously soft wine as a cocktail by itself with savory appetizers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Quite earthy and sun-baked to start, with raisiny aromas that come with cola and leather. Thick, dense and heavy in the mouth, with concentrated, baked flavors of blackberry, pepper and bitter chocolate. A superripe, inky wine with soft tannins and a spongey finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This cool-vintage blend brings light aromas of woodspice, and dried and fresh herbs, with dark cherries lurking in the background. The acids are bright and tart, while the tannins bring some grit, with coffee flavors lingering on the finish. It needs time to come together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Structured but straightforward, it opens with a pretty fragrance of white flowers, yellow apples and a whiff of bread crust, all of which carry over to the ripe, round palate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Some firm tannins give solid structure and smoky character to this wine, an exotic blend of Merlot, Abouriou and Malbec. The juicy berry fruits are round and full in the mouth. It's a ripe wine, with a solid structure that gives balance to the fruitiness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Ripe and soft with rich apple flavor, there's a fullness to this wine. While elegant with a touch of maturity from bottle ageing, the palate is freshened a crispness and levity characteristic of the house style. It has enough weight to accompany food and is ready to drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Dark in color, this is a rich, opulent, almost showy wine. The fruit is ripe, a combination of the sweetest strawberries with black cherries, laced with rich acidity. Then the tannins power in, a dry core of structure and density. Impressive and long-lasting, don't touch this wine for another six years at least."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"An herbaceous selection, this leads with aromas of just-dried grass and yellow florals that are coupled with notes of green plum, melon rind and lime pith. The medium-weight palate is lifted by ample acidity, although the finish ends ripe and fruity. Drink up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Pretty scents of rosewater, raspberries and cherries introduce this light and pleasing wine. It carries some of the charm of a good strawberry soda, with forward fruit and a delicate frame. That said, it is not just a simple fruity wine, and gains weight and complexity as it breathes. Give it time to show you all it has."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A touch of yeast and sage emerges amidst lime peel scents on the nose of this wine. The palate reinforces those flavors, while white pepper and lime notes tingle around the edges. It's lean but concentrated and finishes with such a clean and refreshing zip that you just want to sip more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Oak-influenced notes of cherry, strawberry preserves, pastis, nutmeg and leather. Medium to full bodied, this wine feels round on entrance, with its tannins and acids picking up steam as it progresses across the palate. The long, tangy finish tastes of bloody meat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Estate-grown from a small family winery and entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is savory in earthy truffle, subdued plum, black cherry and tobacco leaf. A complex intermingling of pencil shavings and cedar round things out. On the palate the generous tannins are sure to smooth over time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Slightly rustic earthy aromas of animal, blackberry, plum and cola feed into a jammy palate with just enough acidic pop. Chocolaty blackberry flavors are touched up by resiny oak, while this blend of 85% Monastrell and 15% Syrah tastes similar on a persistent finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The nose is quite subdued, it offers buoyant orange and apricot flavors. An easy, juicy wine, neatly balanced with brisk, citrusy acidity. Drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A bright, fresh Syrah delicious in restrained blackberry and blueberry fruit, it has a luscious mouthfeel, plenty of acidity and an undercurrent of wild herb. This wine is a standout, ready to pair with something gamey dribbled in black pepper sauce."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A ripe full wine shows the richness of this appellation and also its potential for aging. Its lime and green-plum fruits are shot through with acidity and balanced by a tangy rich texture. Drink from 2028."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A well structured Cab with plenty of cassis, blackberry and black cherry aromas and flavors. Subtly smoky vanilla, herbal and roasted coffee notes complement the fruit on the palate. The mouthfeel is soft and supple and the finish appropriately long."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This easy-drinking Shiraz features some plummy—almost pruny—fruit aromas, facile plum and berry flavors, little tannin and bright acids on the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is the winery's best blend. It's been a consistently excellent wine, showing a fuller body, richer, deeper fruit and an oakier overlay than the regular Pinot Noir. The red fruits veer into blue and black fruits, even ripe blue plums and mocha. With some dusty tannins, it could develop over the next six years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Here's a lofty, noble Cab that boasts great power and intensity. The nose is redolent of black plum, spice, green leaf, molasses and a touch of cinnamon. Firm tannins and thick density back its penetrating effect."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Dark fruit and astringent tannins make for a bold and hearty first impression. Opens with a dark inky color and delivers aromas of prune, plum, cola, tar and old spice. Pair it with aged Pecorino cheese."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a good, solid Pinot Noir, a little rustic and direct, but offering lots of drinking pleasure. It's dry and silky, with rich black cherry, raspberry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Drink over the next year or two."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Fruity and medium dry, this is soft, with citrus hits to balance the sweetness. The wine is bright and light in the mouth, better as an apéritif than with food."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"An austere nose gives way in time to smoky tobacco, red currant and minerally acidity, the wine intense on the palate without being over the top. Along the way, hits of cedar and milk chocolate complement the proceedings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A wine is concentrated from the low yields and wonderfully juicy, fresh fruits. Apple and spiced pear flavors are totally freshened by the bright, crisp acidity. Drink from 2024."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A superb, mature wine that is ripe, toasty and full of yellow- and white-fruit flavors. A fine balance brings up spice, an opulent texture, a taut edge of steel and a feeling that this fine wine is ready to drink. It can age, and it will be better over the next few years as its secondary aromas stay in balance with the fruitiness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"For the price, this is a solid Chardonnay, offering up just you might expect. Hints of toasty oak, a suggestion of custardy textural richness and intense citrus fruit come together in a medium-bodied wine that should prove versatile at the table through the end of 2026."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Hints of spring ramps and earth blow off with aeration to reveal pretty floral and lemon aromas on this off-dry, single-vineyard Pinot Blanc. The palate is a bit demure in fruit concentration, but brisk lemon-lime acidity shines through the richly textured palate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This medium- to full-bodied wine manages to be mouth-filling and round without being excessively soft or syrupy. A savory, meaty, coffee-like note complements the ripe blackberry fruit, which persists a good long time on the finish. Drink now–2025."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Subdued aromas of pear peel give way to fleshy pear fruit framed with grapefruit acidity. Harmonious and reined-in, the wine combines elegance with fruity concentration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"There's a cut of acidity that slices through the richness, interfering with the palate's enjoyment of this dry, silky Pinot Noir. Its flavors are of cherry tart, with the sweet, smoky crust, and a splash of cherry liqueur. Drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This wine is all fruit, ripe and full in the mouth. Touches of wood aging have given an extra dimension to the berry fruits and bright acidity. It's ready to drink."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a very good, everyday bubbly. It's dryish and crisp, with honey, orange, strawberry and leesy flavors. The mouthfeel is a little rough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of Sherry and barrel resin are all you get from this wood-fermented, oxidized number. While neither foul nor severe, the all-wood nature of this is overly dominant and not pleasant enough to stand on its own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Pretty aromas show concentrated lemon and honey highlights. Once tasted, they carry through with flavors of orange marmalade, maple syrup and brown sugar. Sweet but not cloying, it's a slice of lemon pie in a glass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Standard berry aromas show touches of raisin and earth, but not too much of either. It feels fresh, crisp and alert, with cherry tomato, berry fruit, tobacco and vanilla flavors. This feels healthy but not real deep or complex on the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Slightly floral on the nose, with some pear and nectarine as well, this light-bodied wine blends sweet stone-fruit flavors with tart green apples on the palate, giving it a degree of balance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Peppery, berry-ish, full-fruited smokiness. This has verve, energy and dark blackberry fruit while freshness lends focus. Very enjoyable indeed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Intense and elegant, it brings together sensations of violet, crushed red berry, mineral and cake spices that are supported by firm but fine tannins and brisk acidity. Fermented with wild yeasts, it illustrates the vibrant character of the vintage. Drink 2022–2040."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Savory aromas of roasting meat and beef jerky are enhanced by pretty touches of lilacs, violet and chocolate syrup on the nose of this bottling. The slightest kiss of strawberry shows on the sip, followed by riper blackberry, purple flowers, rosemary and pepper. The firm tannic structure ensures ageability."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Engaging scents suggesting rose, iris, perfumed berry and Mediterranean herb meld together in the glass. The soft, bright palate offers red cherry, raspberry, a hint of tobacco and a coffee note alongside supple tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of moist underbrush, violet, red berry and a whiff of espresso lead the way. The simple, somewhat diluted palate delivers fresh strawberry and a note of white pepper with easygoing tannins and bright acidity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"From the Côtes de Provence, this is a lightweight sparkling rosé wine that boasts tasty strawberry and sour-apple flavors. A hint of chocolate creeps in on the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Opening with a pretty honeysuckle nose, this Viognier is completely in balance, with layers of lime and pineapple and restrained weight. Enjoy with Thai papaya salad or ceviche."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A steely wine, its acidity dominating the attractive toast, white fruits and grapefruit flavors. It is rich, full in the mouth, a wine that shows some opulence while also preserving a firm, strict structure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Too soft by far, with sugary sweet, medicinal cherry-berry flavors and a sharp cut of acidity. Tastes like an inexpensive Port."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A bit crude in tannins and with some green flavors, but not bad for this price. Gives enough blackberry, licorice and cedar flavors to satisfy, and the finish is dry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Sultry and inviting aromas of buttercream, custard and white peach are sliced by Meyer-lemon juice, salt and jasmine on the nose of this single-vineyard expression. It's finely tuned on the palate, delivering butterscotch and pecan flavors dissected by razor-sharp acidity and a chalky texture."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Soft richness of the vintage, its tannins are velvety and ripe. Blackberry fruits and mint shine through the smoky edge of tannins to give a wine that has both generous fruits and a tight end that brings in bright acidity. It is just ready to drink, although it will be better from 2026."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Smells fresh and lemony, with accents of smoke and butter. You also get sweetish lemon flavors, with a real attack of acidity. The wine is a little spritzy, which isnÕt all that bad, although it may be better as an aperitif than a food wine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Perfumed and crisp, with bright lemon and tangy citrus flavors. It is a delicious, young, fruity and ready to drink."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Sumptuous on the nose with aromas of lychee, rose petals and honeycomb. On the palate, it's dry yet juicy with melon and stone fruit flavor. Enjoy now for its voluptuous exuberance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Made entirely with the native grape Bombino Nero, this informal light-bodied wine has subdued aromas of wild cherry and a hint of crushed herb. The aromas carry over to the über-simple palate along with a hint of pink grapefruit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A lush, attractive young wine filled with the flavors of ripe blackberries, black currants, tar, chocolate, cedar and pepper, its tannins are hard and a little astringent. Give it a few years or serious decanting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aged in wood, this very fine wine shows sophisticated tannins, complex spice, black-plum fruits and a judicious shot of acidity. It is a fine wine, still young and showing a good potential for aging. Drink from 2029."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Lightly briny citrus aromas. Chunky palate that's acidic and driven, tropical with flavors of passion fruit and kiwi. A plump finish is slightly oily in feel and briny in flavor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Talk about an incredibly ripe wine; this deals prune, marzipan, tobacco and sandalwood aromas along with loads of blackberry and cassis. In the mouth, it's tannic like nails, with enormous blackberry and chocolate flavors that narrow down on a fast-charging but ultimately short finish. You can equate this to a rough and bumpy road that takes you to a nice vista. Drink through 2023."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Creamy, oaky and buttery, with a scour of acidity that feels out of place. The underlying flavors are of apricots and oranges. Pretty good, in a country style."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Vanilla wraps itself around cherry, cranberry and pomegranate to open with a ripe bang before this wine delves into darker tar notes and big tannins. Powerfully dense and concentrated, it maintains an herbal overtone that suggest further potential over time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"You'll find plenty of tart green gooseberries in this dry Sauvignon Blanc. Yet there are also ripe grapefruit, kiwi and papaya flavors. It's a refreshingly clean wine for drinking now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Couldn't get any riper, with an explosion of blackberries, cherries, currants, plums, and cola, not to mention plenty of toasty, caramelized oak. Trades complexity and subtlety for sheer power."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This refined Malagouzia starts with a fleshy peach and melon nose, followed by pronounced flavors of peach, citrus and spice on the palate. Balanced and pretty, the fruit tones linger on the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Boysenberry, cracked peppercorn and caramel frame the nose of this rich red. Although not particularly complex, lush flavors of berry juice and espresso on the palate prove rather tasty and enjoyable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Woodland berry, toast, sawdust, grilled herb and camphor are some of the aromas that emerge on this. On the rather slim palate, licorice, orange peel and rose add interest to fresh strawberry while assertive tannins provide the framework. It finishes on a slightly bitter note of dried sage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A blend of four grapes, this structured wine shows big black fruitiness along with fresh acidity. It's still young, bright with acidity and needs time to round out. Drink from 2027."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A rich red blend that opens with blackberry, rum cake, Indian spice, cola and ground clove. It combines intensity and complexity with a bold, opulent mouthfeel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This simple Extra Dry Prosecco opens with peach, nectarine, simple lines and a watery mouthfeel. The sparkler's momentum is achieved mostly by the creaminess of its bubbles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This full-bodied wine relies more on its rich texture and nutty, mineral flavors than on the usual citrus and herb notes, so it's rather thick in profile. It has the heft of a Chardonnay and savory, almond-like accents that are worth appreciating."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Full of spice, ripe toastiness and rich apple flavors, this structured wine has good potential. Lively acidity brings out the citrus and freshness of the wine. Drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This 10-acre estate dates from the 16th century. Today, it has produced a solidly structured wine with firm tannins and a dense textured character. The black fruits are firm with considerable intensity and backed with spice and acidity. Drink from 2024."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of prune, red berry, graphite and mint lead the nose. The palate delivers raw red cherry, black pepper, anise and sage alongside bright acidity and compact tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A bit too hot for complete balance, the result of high alcohol. Other than that, it's rich, full bodied and delicious in berry, cassis and oak flavors."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The bouquet deals some peach, custard and a slight hint of oak, while the palate runs racy, fresh and citrusy. If you like a fresher style with strong orange and tropical fruit flavors, this is your ticket."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Made using organically farmed fruit, this is a fresh, steady and youthful expression. It boasts simple lines, with loads of lemony freshness on the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Lightly textured and velvety in feel, Judson Hale's Yorkville Highlands Pinot Noir has a bigger fruit expression than many of its brethren from cooler parts of the nearby Anderson Valley, with ripe red fruit front and center and a big, slightly woody finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah all aged in neutral oak, it's jazzy and appealing with notes of blue fruit, raspberry, smoked meat and peppery spices showing good purity and richness. It's nowhere near as weighty as the labeled alcohol level might suggest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Tight and compact, this delivers tangy, spicy intensity that's packed around a solid core of red fruit. The midpalate is driven by sensations of cherry, cassis and blackberry, and the finish shows signs of smoky barbecue and roasted chestnut."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This rich and structured wine is packed with both ripe black fruits and concentrated tannins. It is a big wine, a fine representation of this appellation with its dense flavors and aging potential. The wine should be ready from 2029."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Barbecue and lusty stews are what this wine wants. It's dryish to sweet in raisin, blackberry jam, chocolate, beef jerky and spice flavors, and the tannins are big and tough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of forest floor, baked plum, clove and a balsamic whiff of eucalyptus lead the nose. The firmly structured palate offers fleshy wild cherry, raspberry, star anise, tobacco and nutmeg alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2022–2028."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This wine's red apple, flower and lees aromas lead to off-dry, leesy fruit flavors that seem a bit heavy and weighed down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Whiffs of lychee and pink grapefruit accent fresh florals on this slightly off-dry Gewürztraminer. It's plush on the palate with juicy stone-fruit flavors, but also bright with lemony acidity. Finishes elegantly with a murmur of tea-leaf tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Spiced apple and light oak aromas are clean and attractive. This wine feels racy and pure, with good acidic kick. Flavors of nectarine and wood are compatible, while this barrel-fermented Viura (with 10% Malvasia) is solid on the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Lighter-than-usual color and plenty of red cherry, raspberry and turned earth aromas. It offers low-level fruit flavors and good balance of acidity versus ripeness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This ripe, crisp and intensely fruity wine does have a touch of tannin, inevitable with Cabernet Franc, but it is really all about red fruits and refreshing acidity. Drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A creamy, smooth wine, flavored with pears, even lychees and full, ripe Grüner Veltliner. This shows the rich side of the grape, while still keeping its essential freshness. Typical pepper flavors come to finish. Glass stopper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Rusty in color, with aromas of compost and rotten leaves, this isn't cutting it. A drawing hard palate and burnt-out flavors that match the nose make this a hard road to navigate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Relatively soft with as much generous fruit as tannins. Some high-toast oak flavor needs to integrate, while showing great density and concentration. With power behind it, the wine will age seriously. Drink from 2023."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Basic, fresh, honest aromas of red-berry fruits and spice set up a wide, easygoing palate with cassis, blackberry and herbal flavors. Only on the finish does one detect some acidity and rawness. Overall this is a nice Cab for casual drinking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This Christian Roguenant wine, which translates to “Red Falcon,” offers a plump and inviting nose of black plum, cherry, cinnamon,and gingerbread aromas, with a touch of crushed slate. The palate tightens up remarkably, revealing gravel notes and dark berry fruit, proving minerally throughout the sip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Seamless, smoky, supple and seductive. Exotic sandalwood and Asian spices weave from the nose into the palate, wrapped around broad black cherry and blackberry fruit flavors. A darker streak of black olive and licorice runs into a finish replete with tannins that are tight and hint at stem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Shows weight, intense black-currant fruitiness and density from the high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Dark and brooding, it's likely to age for many years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Opens with aromas of toast, espresso, sunbaked earth and mature plum. The structured palate offers black cherries marinated in spirits, vanilla, toasted oak and coffee, while firm, fine-grained tannins provide the framework."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Blackberry and black cherry sauce aromas are given intrigue with tobacco leaf and sharp clove spice. Cinnamon stick and allspice shine on the very spicy palate, which is laid across a boysenberry backbone, with flecks of black pepper throughout."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Subtle and elegant, this opens with a smoky aroma that underscores delicate scents of orchard fruit, citrus and botanical herb. The aromas follow through to the linear palate along with a racy mineral vein. A note of cured meat closes the racy finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is an attractively fruity, soft wine. Balanced between acidity and a lightly crisp texture, it has a touch of yeast although it's the fresh citrus fruit that dominates."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is an easy, fruit-forward wine that would pair well with family dinners and simple pasta dishes. Cherry, bramble, wet earth, pressed violets and light coffee tones characterize the nose and are exactly what you should look for in a no-fuss Chianti. Vibrant berry flavors are carried forward thanks to the wine's smooth structure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A strong, toasted, smoky aroma and charred oak flavors define this medium-bodied, rich-textured wine. Not exactly light on its feet, but fans of oak will appreciate the bold, toasty, buttery character."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"There aren't that many organic Proseccos out there, and this expression from La Jara is thin, crisp and refreshing. There is a pungent grassy note at the outset that needs a few minutes to disappear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Rich, if a little one-dimensional, this has flavors of creamy orange, yellow apricot, vanilla and buttered toast. It will appeal to fans of the forward style of Chardonnay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Earth and black tea meet forest floor notes in this dark, brooding and powerfully full-bodied wine. A touch of reduction accentuates the profuse oak, recalling clove and cardamom, as tingling acidity vies for attention and integration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This Bordeaux-style blend, one of four from this tiny winery, is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon. The somewhat thin cranberry and raspberry fruit, high in acid, is not quite substantial enough to completely shed its candied character."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"With a notable orange tinge, the aromas offer notes of flowers and orange peel, seeming to show a touch of oxygen exposure. It drinks off dry, with abundant orange-rind and smoke flavors."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of charcuterie, smoke and grilled herb lead the nose. On the simple palate, a note of white pepper accents a red-berry core. It's easy drinking, with fresh acidity and soft tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is dry, silky and enormously complex, with flavors of raspberry, cherry, cola, new oak and spice that satisfy through the long finish. The mountain vineyard concentrated the fruit, yielding savory power. It's a beautiful Pinot Noir to drink now with steaks or lamb chops."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This wine has a jammy character with acidity that is unbalanced. Wine is made in cement tanks and aged in cement tanks and new and up to three-year-old French oak barrels."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Blueberry, dried lilac, crushed violet and black pepper form a classic nose on this Merlot-led Bordeaux blend from Paso Robles' celebrated Westside. The well-integrated, complex palate features fruit, herbs, spice and tar, as if each one plays back-to-back solos."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Fleshy black-plum, cherry and blackberry notes lead this medium-weight wine, with a light dusting of cocoa powder. Dark but vibrant in the mouth, with a good amount of pepper and licorice on the finish. Drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aged partly in large casks, this has aromas that recall white flowers, stone fruit, chamomile, subtle oak and flint. The palate offers yellow apple, lemon zest, white peach and smoky graphite alongside fresh acidity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Made in a very ripe, supple style, this medium-bodied wine boasts plenty of dark cherry fruit. Hints of wind-blown dust give it a welcome non-fruity edge, while the silky tannins linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now–2024."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of flowers, green herb, pear and peach lead to silky sleek stone-fruit flavors. There's some interesting things going on but the fruit doesn't quite seem to have fully ripened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This lovely Ribolla Gialla offers thick richness and intensity that entices but never goes overboard. Lingering tones of peach, grapefruit and candied fruit fill in the rear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This wine is soft and round, with attractive acidity as well as a light sense of structure from tannins. It features considerable acidity along with wild strawberry flavors that keep it lifted and aromatic. Drink from 2012."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Delicately scented with white spring blossom and a whiff of tropical fruit, this medium-bodied white offers pineapple, ripe melon and nectarine zest. Lively acidity brightens the enveloping texture."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Pure cherry and cassis aromas carry the bouquet to a juicy and tightly wound palate that bears cassis, chocolate and toast flavors. This hits the spot with a long, lightly herbal and solid finish. Drink now through 2025."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Intensely peachy from nose to finish, this sprightly semisweet sip offers loads of juicy fruity enjoyment. It's easy going and slightly candied on the palate but finishes crisply."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Floral and citric, with clean, juicy aromas that conjure memories of orange blossoms and fresh lime. The palate is light and mildly citric, with melon and papaya flavors bringing a tropical edge. Ready to drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"For a Syrah, this is soft, offering more of the smooth tannins than any bigger structure. It does have weight, with a dusty character and some juicy sweet plums and raisins, leavened by acidity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Concentrated yet balanced, this age-worthy wine is juicy in blackberry and currant, with a chewiness to the palate that gives it strength and power. Tar, tobacco and pencil lead shift around on the palate, before the wine finishes clean and sinewy. Cellar through 2026."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Smooth, sweet in fruit and easy to like. With its jammy flavors of blackberries and mocha, it's delicious, although it would benefit from greater complexity and not so much reliance on sheer intensity and oak."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Ripe fruit, in the form of raspberries, cherries and figs, characterizes this luscious Pinot. But it has much more going for it than that. The tannins are rich and complex, the finish is dry and spicy, and the overall impression is of wine with a great pedigree. Drink over the next six years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Perfumed and structured, this opens with a beautiful fragrance of intense violet layered with bright raspberry and balsamic notes. The palate has nice depth, delivering juicy wild cherry accented with vanilla, cinnamon, mocha and a note of Mediterranean herbs. It's nicely balanced with bright acidity and firm tannins that give it an age-worthy structure. Drink through 2030."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Barbera Vigneto Much showcases sweet aromas of vanilla, cinnamon and cedar wood behind loads of black fruit and wild berries. The wine is lean and compact on the close with a very cleansing, fresh finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Ripe and aromatic yellow pears on the nose combine with bright lemon freshness on the palate to result in a zingy summer wine. Drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"With its extra touch of richness and a feeling of maturity, this remains a benchmark nonvintage Champagne. It has flavors of ripe white fruits, balancing acidity with just a touch of final softness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Ripe and structured, this full-bodied red opens with alluring scents of star anise, dark-skinned berry, underbrush, leather and a balsamic note. On the juicy palate, menthol, licorice and baking spice accent a core of black cherry. Noble tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018–2023."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A soft wine with attractive acidity, red-berry fruits and a gentle texture, the wine is ripe while keeping a backbone of mineral texture. Drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Scents of roasted nuts and apples gain levity on the palate with flavors of lemons and delicate white flowers. Richly textured, this has a slightly-viscous but refreshingly-fruity profile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The timid nose squeaks out notes of Chinese five spice and warm green apple, with a slight hint of sulfur. Light to medium bodied, the palate bears a slight sweetness, tame acids and a quick finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Very tart, with a deep, tannic, earthy mineral streak. There's an iron earth streak running through all Abacela wines; here it comes across as iron and slightly bitter licorice. This is still very young and green; the score might well improve with more time in the bottle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"An exceptionally young wine that tastes like bacon and cherry syrup, this offers an overripe, concentrated and thick drink experience."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Lush aromatics feature sassafras, strawberry pastry and milk chocolate. This forward, seductive wine offers complex red-fruit flavors with details of cinnamon toast, coffee grounds and dark chocolate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This opens with a fragrance of white flowers, hints of vanilla and oak. The palate delivers pineapple and lemon peel flavors and a note of cream pastry, along with well integrated oak. The wine has a soft texture and a small, persistent bead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Terra Valentine's Pinot boasts fruit with long hangtime, and ripe flavors of raspberry and pomegranate. It's rather soft and oaky though so drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Zesty lime and green fern aromas rise from the glass. The palate merely adds a little green pear fruit to this refreshing and enlivening combo of utter cleanness and verve. The linearity and drive make this moreish, very exciting and totally lip-smacking. Echoes of pepper on the aftertaste make it even more intriguing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Creamy notes of pear still carry a hint of flinty smoke, but the pear notes rise with purity. The bright freshness of pure lemon lifts everything and makes for purity, ease, refreshment and blithe joy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a solidly built wine with ripe black-fruit flavors and lots of texture. It looks deeper than usual, smells like blackberries and black pepper, and tastes dry, full and firmly tannic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Vibrant and savory, this delivers wild cherry, dark raspberry, rosemary, mint and Mediterranean herb flavors alongside firm tannins. It closes on a licorice note."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Fresh-pressed blackberry aromas leap out of the glass of this wine, along with asphalt and a touch of purple flowers. The palate is a study of density and thickness, with black plums, coffee and espresso showing most out of the deep, black flavors."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Smoky, dark and rich, this oak-aged Ripasso is packed tight with savory aromas of barbecue smoke, bresaola, licorice and sun-dried fruit. There's a sweet note on the close followed by smooth, soft tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Pineapple and other tropical fruits comprise the simple, straightforward nose. Pear and tangerine flavors come across sharp, as does the finish. The wine is a bit edgy and lean on its own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Wiry berry aromas are jacked up with spice as well as stalky notes. There's a fair amount of astringency to the palate, while flavors of plum and red berries finish juicy but also briny and a touch horsey in flavor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Ripe and soft with rich apple flavor, there's a fullness to this wine. While elegant with a touch of maturity from bottle ageing, the palate is freshened a crispness and levity characteristic of the house style. It has enough weight to accompany food and is ready to drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Slightly backward, particularly given the vintage, the wine has a complex nose with plenty of dark fruit, Turkish delight, smoked meat and earth. A full rich palate, slightly soft, it begins to run out of steam a little in mid palate, but returns with a flourish, and the finish is long and nuanced. Will repay 5+ years of cellaring."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Ripe and plump blackberries shine through in a showcase of fruit purity, lifted by dried fennel, hot black gravel, peppercorns, toasted sesame and soy. There is tremendous structure and acidity on the sip, with black pepper and black-sesame nuance plus juicy boysenberry character to the mid-palate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Heavy wafts of petrol and oak dominate at first in this wine, before some air and some swirling in the glass reveal more lifted aromas and flavors of lemon candy, green apple and apple tart. A tale of two wines in some ways, it zigzags between crisp and luxurious, finding its balance in the glass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Ripe, juicy pear notes make nose and palate immensely appetizing. They are highlighted by zippy, fresh lemon accents that create a lovely balance on this fun, fresh summer wine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This splendid effort is sourced from the Durant Vineyard, and aged in neutral French oak for seven months prior to bottling. Spicy and dense, it's a lively blend of lime, apple, apricot and pear fruits. A trickle of juicy acidity pulls the flavors through into a finish with streaks of vanilla and clove."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This appealing wine offers vanilla, café au lait, black currant, herbs and pepper. Silky-soft black olive flavors show good concentration and length backed by dry tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Gritty aromas of asphalt, green peppercorn, saucy berry and hard spices precede a tight palate with grating tannins. This is oak-heavy, with sweet-and-saucy red-berry flavors. An oaky, tomatoey finish is rubbery in feel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromatic herb, woodland berry, violet, citrus zest and tilled soil scents take shape in the glass. The succulent, linear palate doles out cranberry, red cherry white pepper and star anise flavors, bolstered by a backbone of firm, refined tannins and bright acidity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Shows lots of complexity, with a mèlange of blackberry, cherry, currant, mushu plum sauce, olive tapenade, black pepper and lightly oaked flavors that are wrapped into rich, sturdy tannins. Fine and dry, but a bit on edge now. Give it a year or two to soften."}
