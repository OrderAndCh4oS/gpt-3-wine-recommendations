{"prompt":"","completion":"This is very intense on the nose with blue fruit, cool stones, brambleberries and blackberries. Wet earth, too. Full-bodied and extremely dense and powerful with a super center palate of fruit and ripe yet compact tannins. Lightly chewy and expressive. Superb transparency and integration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Earthy aromas of bark, sand, truffles, graphite, rust, terracotta and sandalwood rise up from the deep with Burgundian poise; fruitier orange zest and preserved lemons glimmer in their wake, while riper incense and tar lurk in this dense forest of aromas. Physics itself gives way as the line between reduction and oxidation is blurred. There’s such richness to the center palate, but the fruit there is vivacious and elegant, swaddled in robust but generous tannins that breach the outermost reaches of the mouth. The finish is hauntingly long, the after effects of the acidity unworldly. This is certainly in a quiet, reserved stage of evolution, and will need time to fully mature in bottle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The most structured Prado Enea ever. A reduced center palate that is so compact with dark fruit, dark mushrooms and cedary spice. Full body. Wonderfully polished tannins and a long, long finish. Electric acidity. Muscular and well toned. The is a new classic that reminds me of great Spanish wines from the 1940s and 1950s."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is big and powerful, without being ripe and heavy. So much apple, stone, and hints of toffee. Aromatic. Full-bodied, layered and framed with phenolic tension and a great finish. Muscular and agile at the same time. One of the best I have tasted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Very pure slate here, this is something unique. The elevated, steep and stony site has such strength of character, delivered with such purity. Gun smoke, gunflint and very fine fragrance with a streak of fresh lemons. So fine. The palate has a super fine and elegant feel, floating ballet-like over the palate. Such elegance and power. The finesse and length is really ethereal. Yellow-grapefruit juice and pith here. Wildly succulent at the long, salty finish. What a thrilling wine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This has such freshness at between nine and ten years of age. It delivers a very rich, blue-fruit core with spiced earth and light, leathery nuances. The palate has composed and compact tannins and a slinky and rich, powerful array of blueberries and a long, juicy, succulent and vibrant finish. Shows just how well Rippon pinots age. This is just getting started! Maturation release."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The aromas here are so spellbinding with shitake mushrooms, wet earth and moss, as well as tree bark and, finally, dark fruit. The palate is incredible as it builds and grows with full body, but always tight and reserved. It shows so much depth and complexity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The purity of fruit on the nose is perfection with cherries, crushed raspberries, mineral, pumice and citrus fruit. Dust, too. Full body. Powerful, chewy tannins. So long and muscular, yet polished and formed. Most structured Brunello I have ever had from here. A wine for decades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Great aromas of dried strawberries and fresh flowers, such as lavender. Full-bodied yet very tight and focused. Impressive tannic structure, but refined and polished. Lightly chewy. Finishes tight and refined."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"The aromas of blackberry leaves and iodine are wild and exotic here with mussel shells and earth underneath. Full-bodied, tight and chewy with powerful tannins that show muscle. It’s structured and powerful. Dense and very, very deep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Exquisite wine with such freshness and complexity, offering abundant red plums, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries with a wealth of fragrance and gently spicy oak – they used a one-year-old vat for this wine – violets and blood oranges. Profound aromatic purity. The palate is elegant and refined and extremely well focused, so layered and plush and very, very long with ribbon-like tannins. Intensity with elegance and discreet power. A trifecta of perfection, this is the third 100-point rating in as many releases."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A slightly more luxurious nature to the 2008 than the great 2007. Full-bodied with a lovely framework of acidity and dry fruit, such as apples, pears and peaches. Opulent. Dense and muscular. Yet, it’s balanced and harmonious. Line of acidity at the end. One for the cellar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a huge and impressive wine, but somehow graceful and subtle. It packs an eclectic array of brambleberry compote, violet essence, eucalyptus, oyster shell, pure iodine, vanilla, resin, tar, cassis, plum liqueur and hot stones. You can only stand back in awe as one shade of fruit appears after the next and a barrage of tannin coats your mouth. Yet, this is gentle, agile and flowing. Nevertheless, its main attraction remains its unashamed, monumental power and muscularity. A haunting wine that sends chills down your spine."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"The intensity of fruit is staggering here, as this stacks up dried peaches, dried strawberries, red licorice, red-plum compote and glazed red cherries, in rapid succession. There’s a breadth of flavor to the palate that will take your breath away; muscular tannins draw in deeply set cherries, melding it together in a glistening coating of acidity, which only helps to carry it longer still. The finish is nearly endless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Fantastic aromas of blackcurrants and other dark fruit with crushed stone, iron and oysters, following through to a full body that shows incredible energy and depth, offering ripe yet fresh fruit, together with bright herbs and earth. Precision and balance of the intensity of the vintage. Layered."}

Very grainy and refined on the palate with a real kick from the orange-rind undertones that permeate the entire palate. Tiptoes like a tightrope walker between power and finesse and executes its mission nearly to perfection."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is quite a remarkable wine that prompts a vision of looking out over a vast orchard of glistening red cherries and red plums, weighing down gnarled, bark-scented trunks. Beneath the fragant canopy, luscious clay soils are interspersed with ferrous deposits and fresh grass stirs. Viscous layers of pure red fruit pour into the palate, soaking the mouth from top to bottom in profuse layers of spices and orange zest. The tannins have the muscle of a bodybuilder, but the acidity dances through the mouth like a ballerina. The finish is limitless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a wonderful syrah with superb density and, at the same time, finesse and a quality of tannin that is most impressive. Raspberries, dark berries and licorice with some violet aromas, following through to a full body with soft, creamy tannins. Superb texture."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is really focused and refined with fantastic dried flowers and dark berries. Dried-lavender and mint undertones. Medium-to full-bodied with refined and polished tannins that are all together and so focused. Really integrated and melted together on the palate. Compact and very linear. Please give this two or three years to come completely together, but it’s already breathtaking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Complex aromas of tar, wet earth, dark berry and flowers follow through to a full body, medium sweet and amazing compacted concentration. Vertical and so deep. It goes on for minutes. Truly excellent."}

Magnificently articulate pinot that is also just utterly delicious and whose style is driven very much by site and soil, both cleverly interpreted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a splendid Brunello, showing extraordinary purity of sangiovese character. Cherry and floral aromas and flavors. Full-bodied with incredibly integrated tannins that seem like they are not there. But they are and are comprehensive on the palate. Great depth and agility. Just floats on the palate. Magic carpet. Drinkable, to enjoy the magic, but needs three or four years to come around."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Impressive roses and finely ground spices with a bright red-cherry core, as well as a fresh wild-herb thread. The sense of focus and purity here is stunning.

Full-bodied with tannins that roll off the palate and flow to the finish. Fine, velvety texture. Lasts for minutes. Already so attractive, but be patient."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The minerality here is astonishing — the citrus fruit is so pure and so powerful that it prickles the inside of your nose like a pickle or heady spice. Crushed bones, wet stones and flint are dialed up nearly to perfection. Talk about vertical? No. Talk about a skyscraper! It has so much energy it nearly explodes, the acidity rising up to infinity and beyond. Staggering freshness and length. If this doesn’t blow you away, nothing will."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This has discreet aromatics, showing very fine stones and yellow grapefruit with a delicate, lemon-blossom perfume. The palate has a scintillatingly intense and focused feel with laser-guided acidity, driving a very long, pure and thrilling palate. Yellow citrus fruit abounds. Such precision is really special and the concentration in 2018 is immense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Incredible aromas of blackberries, hot stones, wet earth and flowers. Full-bodied, it floats across the palate with ultra-fine tannins that melt into the wine. Superb, long finish of subtle fruit and terroir-defined subtleties. Try in 2022, but already a dream to taste."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The concentration and largesse of the 2016 Pichon Baron is apparent from the get-go with incredibly alluring, ripe and expansive fruit aromas in the blackberry, dark-cherry, mulberry and plum zone. Espresso and cedar, as well as a slate-like, stony mineral edge add complexity. The palate has incredible depth, drive and detail. Fine and plush tannins stretch the palate in every direction. So fresh and vivacious, this is the greatest Pichon Baron since 1989 and has a long future."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The aromas of blackberries, cedar, sandalwood and black tea are compelling. Black olives. Rosemary and sage undertones. Full-bodied, rich and powerful Seña with impressive and powerful tannins, yet harmony and balance. Fruit-forward. Lightly chewy. Fresh and energetic wine in a hot year. Broad-shouldered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Breathtaking. Exceptional integration of super ripe blackberries and the very finest oak. The tannins build up beautifully, forming wave upon wave as the wine flows across the palate. Then the wave breaks on your palate and shoots way out at the finish, so that you wonder where it will end and normal life begin again. Needs time to soften, but this is so, so good. Give it two or three years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Amazing, pure cherries, plums and flowers, as well as crushed stones. It jumps out of the glass. Full body, powerful tannins and a freshness and roundness to it. Lightly salty on the finish. Great structure with finesse."}

There’s a fabulous saltiness and oyster-shell undertone to the fruit. Unique. Drinkable already, but this year there’s the structure to last decades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The light rust and amber color is enticing. Aromas of dried rose petals, cinnamon and nutmeg. Hints of dried meat, smoke and sage. Full body and compact, creamy texture. So fine and delicious. Great, subtle and complex flavors. More like a lightly aged, premier cru Volnay, but with the magic of Champagne."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a selection of the estate-vineyard pinot noir that is planted on a solid sheet of parent rock. The nose is ebulliently fruited with intense, poached berries, as well as a pastry-like edge, flowers and stones, serving up what proves to be a deceptively charming, seductive impression. The palate arrives as a layered array of sheet-like tannins in very vertical form; the flavors have to climb up and across to be tasted and they are pristine, fresh cherries and red plums when they arrive. As the flavors abate, the stony, noble tannins remain like a rock face, just begging to be climbed again. Sheer brilliance. Hold for more than a decade, if you can."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is muscular yet so well defined and toned. Full-bodied with deep and dense fruit on the palate, yet powerful and rich at the same time. So much sandalwood and blackberry character. Chewy and rich at the finish. This is a warm and generous wine, but the alcohol is just over 13 degrees. Not that high. Love the finish. Extravagant. Magical."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Super aromas of blackberries, blackcurrants and blueberries. Hints of fresh herbs and tobacco. Iron and ink. Full-bodied, very tight and powerful, yet not too heavy. Lightly chewy and polished. So much nerve and intensity. Super length and depth. Drink after 2025, but a joy to taste now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The aromas of violets and dark berries with licorice and sweet black tea are so attractive. What really impresses is the sweet fruit in the dense middle palate. So attractive. At the same time, there’s plenty of plush and ripe tannins that give the wine form and brightness. And it still remains bright on the finish, as the tannins roll on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Blackberries, blueberries, raspberry kir, sweet tobacco and black truffle. Full bodied with chewy tannins and superb texture and length. Extremely poised and powerful. Finishes with so much fresh leather and blueberries."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a phenomenal Champagne of such purity. It delivers immense power with such refinement. There’s a very precise feel with a super fine, sliced-brioche nose and white-peach, fine-lemon and chalky-mineral notes. So fresh. There’s such intensity, focus and delicacy to the palate. So focused and so detailed with seamless, fluid, ripe-chardonnay flavor and layers of savory baked biscuits, building on the finish. Wonderfully complete structure and texture. The power here is considerable and the acidity drive is simply wild."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The pure fruit and juicy tannins are so succulent and enticing. Full body and soft, silky tannins. Complete. Everything is where it should be.

{"prompt":"","completion":"The aromas here are amazing: crushed blueberries and raspberries with wet earth and dried flower. Orange blossom. Tar and stone. Full body, very sweet but the powerful and fine-grained tannins balance the wine out. Tannins and fruit envelop your mouth with each sip. Great potential. Single vineyard port."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is an old-vine Port with two-thirds coming from ancient ones. Bark, black tea, crushed grapes and mahogany. Big and grippy. Old, traditional styled Port with incredible depth and power. Big yet polished tannins. This is foot-trodden. Co-fermented. Real deal."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"This pinot has an x-factor that sets it apart. There’s an almost peppery edge to the violet, blueberry and red-cherry nose with sappy and earthy elements, as well as roasted game and fragrant baking spices. The palate has a very plush, attractive and fresh array of vibrant and detailed pinot fruit on offer. Long and precise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a mind-boggling syrah that has a nose more reminiscent of a white than a red and shows ethereal aromas of peaches, persimmon, milk chocolate, barley and Chinese plums. So polished and effortless on the palate, floating between layer upon layer of violets and lavender and then on to juicy but muscular tannins that coat the palate and keep the fruit long and nearly endless. Drink now or hold for a long time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Speechless here. I thought the 2015 was already perfect but this is perfect, too. But in a different way. It is so structured and multidimensional. Full-bodied, powerful and intense with incredible tannin backbone and depth. The dark-berry, wet-earth, oyster-shell and mushroom flavors are phenomenal. Give it four or five years to come together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Very complex and alluringly spicy aromas that bubble in and out of the nose, together with fresh tobacco, raspberries and iodine, moving into blackcurrants, blackberries and a gently gravely, stony edge. The palate has incredible polish that is a foil for the intense power and concentration of this wine. The texture is flawless, building smoothly with fine-grained and focused tannins that sustain a long, fresh finish. The new 1986, which was a legend. This is probably better."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A selection of old vines in Morstein. Super refined, steely notes of flint and oyster shell with fragrant spices and delicate, white wild flowers. Sweet, freshly rolled pastry, fine lemons and grapefruit, too. This is so complex and quite cryptic for now. Impenetrable. The palate also delivers a very complex impression. Very layered and finely detailed with acidity that guides a stream-like fusion of stone-fruit and yellow-citrus flavors. Very compressed, very dense and very complete."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Fresh blueberries and brambleberries take center stage, which is striking for a wine of this age. There are also lots of roasted herbs, such as sage, not to mention floral elements, including lavender and dried violets. Then come cedar, sandalwood and tar. The tannins are incredibly round and soft, without the slightest hint of anything dry. This is among the most elegant of Riojas, where the acidity is wonderfully pronounced and cuts right through any touch of dried fruit. Long and powerful, yet subtle on the finish. Drink now, or hold for a very long time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The complexity of this is something very special with dark berries, hot stone, iodine, and oyster shells. Full-bodied, very tight and polished with creamy tannins that envelop your palate, caressing every inch. Deep and dark fruit and wet earth at the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"An exceptional chardonnay with a wealth of very fresh and slightly flinty lemon, grapefruit, white-peach and grilled-hazelnut aromas. The palate has such grace and well-defined, pure lemon and grapefruit, as well as white and yellow peaches. The toasted-hazelnut afterglow is stunning. Hints of praline, too. So elegant, pristine and pure. Exceptional."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is always an entrancing Gran Selezione and the 2016 shows dried raspberries, boysenberries, vanilla and brambleberries. Full-bodied and tightly wound with eye-catching minerality. The acidity sharpens out the exuberant red fruit perfectly. Incredible length and drinkability. Is this better even than the great 2015? I think so. From organically grown grapes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"OMG. This grenache is unworldly. Not only does this pack just about as much black fruit within the nose as you could possibly imagine, but there is nuance upon nuance of earthy complexity. Dried orange rind, pine needles, iodine, violets, blood orange, black pepper, bark, forest floor and oyster shell. So velvety on the palate, which is caressed by tannins of pure silk and acidity of pure steel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Really pristine fruit aromas here with such pure, ripe red cherries and roses, as well as gently earthy and spicy nuances. Very fresh, precisely ripe and a pinot you can sit and just breathe in for days. The palate has a velvety layer that few others manage to find; silky at the core, succulent in the center and delivering such vibrant, red-cherry flavors in a long, pristine and fresh, red-cherry finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The purity of fruit to this is really something else. I am not sure I have tasted a young Spanish wine with such purity. The crushed-blackberry, violet and sandalwood aromas with dried black tea are so enticing. They really catch your mind. The fruit and tannin texture to this is impeccable, as it just folds together on the palate and delivers a perfect balance of fruit and texture. Dances on your palate. You have to drink it now. But it will age forever."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Wonderfully complex aromas of tobacco flowers, violets, blueberries and black olives. Full-bodied, dense and very polished with fine, chewy tannins and a flavorful finish. The tannins are right and solid. This needs two or three years to soften, but shows great promise, as always."}

This is an exceptional Clos."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"From a one-hectare parcel of pinot noir, planted in 1964.

The palate has intensity that is truly bracing and delivers such power and length. Exceptional!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a profound wine, offering really striking depth of aromas and flavors with a resonance that really stops you still. Dark stones, ripe dark plums and blackberries, licorice, sarsaparilla, orange peel and cloves with still more spices floating in the midst. The palate has such perfectly captured intensity of ripe dark plums and blackberries that it is seemingly impenetrable for now. Yet, the detail is all here. It builds and fills the palate completely with ripe, espresso-laced blackberries, black cherries and dark plums and delivers such freshness at the finish. This is a triumph and up there with the greatest La Landonne releases."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Spectacular aromas of crushed berries, such as blueberries and raspberries. Fresh flowers with hints of sandalwood. Exotic. Saturated palate of so much fruit, yet remains agile and energetic. Great length and texture. Fills your mouth. This needs time, but a classic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"OMG. Blackberries, blackcurrants, blueberries, licorice, and spearmint. Mint, too. Full-bodied, so tight and poised with super tightness and focus. Phenomenal depth and composure. This shows real Napa character that harkens back to the Heitz Martha’s 1968. Benchmark to consider."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is phenomenal. The precision and brightness is amazing with ultra-fine tannins that are so polished and so beautiful. Full to medium body and fabulous fruit. Wonderful length and beauty. The purity and balance is incredible. Dark berries, walnuts and dark chocolate. Makes you want to drink it now, but be patient and revel in the greatness."}

Aromas of orange and lemon peel to start, then graphite, blackberries, plum paste, black cherries, boundless sweet oak spice, fresh cedar, tar, mahogany, roasted coffee and chocolate - the list goes on. Such complexity. Classic Grange, offering such deep, dark intensity. The palate has immense richness and depth with a super succulent and very long, fleshy, deeply weighted array of dense, velvet-wrapped tannins that run so long.

{"prompt":"","completion":"It’s the fruit tea and hibiscus that really lifts this, not to mention the roasted herbs that lurk beneath the surface. But there’s no shortage of dried fruit either, whether it be dried cherries, dried plums or Christmas cake. It’s a real mouth-coater, showing sheer elegance in a bottle, encapsulated in the tannins that weave an ornate tapestry, hung between every corner of the palate. Full-bodied and very, very long. Best ever?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is always an eye-catching white, but 2017 is on another level. It takes you on a journey through a field of buttercups and edelweiss, before moving through riper notes of mangoes and apricot pastries. Candied citrus is always lingering in the background. The palate is where it really goes into another realm, though, opening through agile mineral and stoney nuances into denser tropical and stone fruit and then onto rich, structured phenolics. The salty finish is seemingly endless with acidity that sabers through the lightly oxidative aftertaste with subtle reduction. What a wine! This has to be the best ever from here — by a mile."}

Integrated hints of bark and sandalwood. Full-bodied with strapping tannins and muscular, imposing structure and power. Notwithstanding, everything is in striking balance and delivered with remarkable precision and grit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Extremely perfumed aromas of tangerines and violets with blackberries, cassis and wet earth. Full-bodied yet reserved and very precise with amazing purity of currants, blackberries and lightly burnt oranges. Superb finish of firm yet extremely polished tannins. Perfect. Hard not to drink now, but better after four to five years."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Let go of the narrow human world and fall into this expansive dry riesling that busts out of the conventional framework for the grape variety. And that's what makes it so difficult to describe. However, there is certainly more yellow fruit (mirabelle, but also a hint of pineapple) than white (some ripe pear) and the minerality is huge, yet totally precise and delicate. The finish really doesn't want to stop!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Ravishing bouquet of a thousand golden fruits and a staggering interplay of diamond-bright acidity and great succulence. Then, just when you think you've processed all that, along comes a monster wave of minerality, which sweeps you off your feet. But you land on the beach, deliriously happy."}

The palate has a powerful, layered, long and symphonic feel and is packed with rich red-plum and black-cherry flavor. Such attractive freshness and majestically long, smoothly wrapped tannins. The finish is so long, seamless, profoundly pure and perfectly balanced. Freshens into a lasting, plum-stone finish. This is incredible, the best Wendouree shiraz of the modern era. A single parcel of 1919 Eastern Vineyard plantings. Already quite approachable but"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The purity of fruit here is so stunning with blackberry, black-cherry, black-truffle and floral aromas, as well as orange peel.

{"prompt":"","completion":"This is really muscular and really powerful. It is amazing. Full-bodied, yet tight and super structured with incredible power and super toned tannins. It goes on for minutes. The greatest Barbaresco ever from here? I love the strength with fruit finesse. I don’t remember tasting a young Asili like this. Give this a lot of time to come together. One for the cellar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Wow. This is archetypal Barolo with a solid cylinder of polished tannins running through the center of the wine from start to finish.

This is breathtakingly pure, yet complex and drinkable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"One of the wines of this challenging vintage in Alsace, this is a masterpiece of concentrated minerality, but also has a seductive, kaleidoscopic array of yellow and exotic-fruit aromas (most obviously puréed peach).

From the estate’s oldest vines on the granitic Grand Cru Schlossberg."}

Aromas of fresh redcurrants, red and violet flowers, subtle spice, fresh earth, paper bark, fresh-picked thyme and sage, red berries and some cedary notes. The palate is stunning and has a brand of elegance with power that is found in only the greatest wines. Pristine mulberries, red plums, blueberries and red cherries sail through layers of fine tannin, into an unwaveringly long and vibrant finish. An exceptionally concentrated and convincing Diana Madeline release, this is one of their finest. Delicious now, but his will bloom from 2028."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a great edition of this standard bearer for elegant Yarra Valley claret. The nose is detailed and fresh with a central theme of red and dark berries, cedar, cocoa powder, violet-like florals and light leafy notes.

A great Armagh for sure.and drink over the following two decades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A significant vintage for Hill of Grace, as the last 2015 red to leave the Henschke cellar, and a wine that delivers on every ounce of its promise and then some. The nose is so complex and fragrant with trademark brown spices taking center stage, amid light espresso, sage leaves, blackberries, cinnamon, anise, orange peel, ripe dark plums, pepper, gun smoke and a gentle, dried-rose edge. The palate has such impressive layers of fine tannin that make an instantly seamless, powerful and focused impression. It has architectural style with clean lines that build and ascend out of the finish. Long, spiced blackberries and dark plums are extruded in formation with such finesse and power. The acidity holds a torch to the rich, ripe plums and blackberries, illuminating freshness at the finish. A wine that will develop in a very consistent manner and likely to be at its best some 20 years from now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Wow. Blackberries, lead pencil, dried flowers, black olives and purple fruit. Full body and super polished and refined tannins. Creamy and well defined. So polished. Nutmeg, clove and other dried spices. It goes on for minutes. Superb."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"So deep, yet so subtle, this is a Rheingau masterpiece that's as deep as a fjord.

And then you fall into a seductive black hole at the very long, cool and dark finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The deepest waters are the most mysterious, because you look ever further down and never know what you're going to discover another five fathoms deeper. And just so, this beautiful riesling has seductive fruit that drags you into an abyss of beauty and joy. What stunning texture, and what a long, refined finish."}

Astonishing interplay of intense, herbal and mineral notes and tart, exotic-fruit flavors through the super long finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Super white with dried-apple, peach, stone and mineral aromas and flavors. It’s full-bodied with layers of really complex, ripe fruit and bright acidity. Undertones of cream and nougat. Seamless texture. Rioja’s answer to grand cru Burgundy. From organically grown grapes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A tight, linear red with plums, chocolate and walnuts and some forest-floor and porcini mushroom undertones. Complex and aromatic. Full-bodied with dense, chewy tannins that are intense and powerful. Flavorful and long. Opulent. Don’t drink before 2024."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a wine with fantastic dark fruit with subtle nutmeg and hints of Spanish cedar. Lead pencil and slate, too. Full-bodied, yet so refined and polished. It’s endless on the finish. Needs two or three years to come together."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a great Yquem, delivering thrilling purity and intensity. The nose offers intense aromas of fresh and dried apricot and peach pastry, as well as freshly baked creme brulee, candied and fresh orange and kumquat. Some marmalade, too. Smooth, glossy texture with flavors of grilled orange, dried apricot and an exceptionally long finish with a powerful, driving push to the end. A flicker of toasty-oak influence arrives late, but this wine has completely consumed the oak. The 2017 Yquem is a very powerful wine from a very rich and exceptional vintage. The acidity has a big hand in balancing the richness. Pithy finish. The phenolics deliver some great depth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Maybe I'm amazed! In spite of the density and concentration, this retains the light-footed and filigree character that are typical for this great vineyard site. A cornucopia of dried stone and tropical fruit, but also spices, dried herbs, a whiff of licorice and much else besides. Only just beginning to show what it's made of!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"At first, a biscuity note that reminds me of Champagne, but then a delicate and cool, peachy aroma comes through. I wanted to write that this has stunning concentration and brilliance, but actually it’s just like a laser beam that shoots across your palate, leaving you stunned and delighted. Enormous mineral freshness. From organically grown grapes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This pure cabernet sauvignon is the real deal with redcurrant and terracotta character on both the nose and palate. It’s full-bodied, yet really reserved and ultra-refined.

Incredible triumph for the vintage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A creamy and tightly wound red with crushed berries and flowers, as well as minerals and stones.

Deeply complex, intense aromas of fresh dark cherries, orange-peel and violets, as well as blueberries and a subtle, earthy edge. Wet stones here, too. The palate is so very silky and has a plush, vibrant and fluid texture with seamless delivery of ripe red and dark-cherry flavor in supple and silky mode. This is very open and drinkable. Very complete and long."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is really powerful and tightly structured with super depth and compression of fruit on the palate and some phenolic tension. This is made in concrete eggs and large casks. Purity is the word. but already superb."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a selection of the estate-vineyard pinot noir that is planted on a solid sheet of parent rock. It has an air of restraint from the first impression of crushed roses and violets with some sappy, fresh and attractive leaves and succulent plant notes and plenty of finely fragrant spices, cocoa, blueberry and dried dark cherry. The palate has a very smooth-honed tannin texture with cherry-pip flavor and a very silky, polished mouth feel. The grain of tannin is super tight and lustrous. The core of this intense tannin creates a sensation of enlivened tension that sets this wine apart, not only in the Antica Terra family, but from the vast majority of wines per se. It is so expressive, within a focused spectrum of characters, and has such energy and presence. A striking expression of pinot noir."}

Very concentrated, yet cool and focused, with a very precise interplay of tangerine fruit, wet-stone minerality and a hint of oak that echoes down the valleys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Very perfumed and aromatic with blackcurrant, sweet-tobacco and Spanish-cedar character. Full-bodied with ultra fine tannins that build on the palate and take the fruit and other flavors to an endless finish. More refined than the perfect 2018 and almost as compelling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This shows incredible depth of fruit with strawberry, cherry and phenolics. Full-bodied and layered with an incredible, three-dimensional element to the wine. This is so transparent and dynamic with dark fruit, yet it remains vivid and bright. Refined and precise, it goes on and on. Really savory, fresh and incredibly pinot-noir-like. What a wine. 13 years of maturation in the bottle. So drinkable now, but it will age for many years ahead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Extremely perfumed and beautiful with ripe strawberries and citrus fruit, as well as aromatic flowers. Full-bodied with plenty of fruit and creamy, chewy tannins that are polished and very impressive. Long and linear. One of the best of this bottling. Drink after 2023, but already a gorgeous bottle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"What a stunningly fresh nose for a five-year-old Alsace dry riesling. Vibrant nose of fresh pineapple with a whole garden of fresh-herb aromas. Rich and concentrated, but also cool and delicate at the front, then comes stunning, racy power that drives across the palate with great mineral energy. Doesn’t want to stop at the finish. From organically grown grapes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Extraordinary aromas of white peaches, apricots, vanilla and flowers. Full-bodied and very sweet with so much sweet and dried fruit, such as apricots and tangerines, yet it maintains citrusy freshness and texture, with a long, very sweet finish. Always energetic and vivid. Great length to this. It’s a sweet wine to drink when young, to marvel over the intensity and verve, yet also one to age for decades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Extremely aromatic with strawberries, flowers, and stones, following through to a full body with layers of fruit and round tannins that go on and on. Rich and opulent, yet polished and toned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Spicy and earthy notes of ginseng, dried pineapple, candied citrus, fig and toffee apple. The sweetness is balanced and complemented by earthy, complex layers. Lots of spicy botrytis character. Extremely long. Complex and thought-provoking with so much dried-fruit and spicy flavor at the end. Dense and tight, yet agile. Delicious now, but if you give it another five or six years, you will see even more."}
