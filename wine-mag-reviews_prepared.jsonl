{"prompt":"","completion":"Soft richness of the vintage, its tannins are velvety and ripe. Blackberry fruits and mint shine through the smoky edge of tannins to give a wine that has both generous fruits and a tight end that brings in bright acidity. It is just ready to drink, although it will be better from 2026."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Smells fresh and lemony, with accents of smoke and butter. You also get sweetish lemon flavors, with a real attack of acidity. The wine is a little spritzy, which isnÕt all that bad, although it may be better as an aperitif than a food wine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Perfumed and crisp, with bright lemon and tangy citrus flavors. It is a delicious, young, fruity and ready to drink."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Sumptuous on the nose with aromas of lychee, rose petals and honeycomb. On the palate, it's dry yet juicy with melon and stone fruit flavor. Enjoy now for its voluptuous exuberance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Made entirely with the native grape Bombino Nero, this informal light-bodied wine has subdued aromas of wild cherry and a hint of crushed herb. The aromas carry over to the über-simple palate along with a hint of pink grapefruit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A lush, attractive young wine filled with the flavors of ripe blackberries, black currants, tar, chocolate, cedar and pepper, its tannins are hard and a little astringent. Give it a few years or serious decanting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aged in wood, this very fine wine shows sophisticated tannins, complex spice, black-plum fruits and a judicious shot of acidity. It is a fine wine, still young and showing a good potential for aging. Drink from 2029."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Lightly briny citrus aromas. Chunky palate that's acidic and driven, tropical with flavors of passion fruit and kiwi. A plump finish is slightly oily in feel and briny in flavor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Talk about an incredibly ripe wine; this deals prune, marzipan, tobacco and sandalwood aromas along with loads of blackberry and cassis. In the mouth, it's tannic like nails, with enormous blackberry and chocolate flavors that narrow down on a fast-charging but ultimately short finish. You can equate this to a rough and bumpy road that takes you to a nice vista. Drink through 2023."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Creamy, oaky and buttery, with a scour of acidity that feels out of place. The underlying flavors are of apricots and oranges. Pretty good, in a country style."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Vanilla wraps itself around cherry, cranberry and pomegranate to open with a ripe bang before this wine delves into darker tar notes and big tannins. Powerfully dense and concentrated, it maintains an herbal overtone that suggest further potential over time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"You'll find plenty of tart green gooseberries in this dry Sauvignon Blanc. Yet there are also ripe grapefruit, kiwi and papaya flavors. It's a refreshingly clean wine for drinking now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Couldn't get any riper, with an explosion of blackberries, cherries, currants, plums, and cola, not to mention plenty of toasty, caramelized oak. Trades complexity and subtlety for sheer power."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This refined Malagouzia starts with a fleshy peach and melon nose, followed by pronounced flavors of peach, citrus and spice on the palate. Balanced and pretty, the fruit tones linger on the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Boysenberry, cracked peppercorn and caramel frame the nose of this rich red. Although not particularly complex, lush flavors of berry juice and espresso on the palate prove rather tasty and enjoyable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Woodland berry, toast, sawdust, grilled herb and camphor are some of the aromas that emerge on this. On the rather slim palate, licorice, orange peel and rose add interest to fresh strawberry while assertive tannins provide the framework. It finishes on a slightly bitter note of dried sage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A blend of four grapes, this structured wine shows big black fruitiness along with fresh acidity. It's still young, bright with acidity and needs time to round out. Drink from 2027."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A rich red blend that opens with blackberry, rum cake, Indian spice, cola and ground clove. It combines intensity and complexity with a bold, opulent mouthfeel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This simple Extra Dry Prosecco opens with peach, nectarine, simple lines and a watery mouthfeel. The sparkler's momentum is achieved mostly by the creaminess of its bubbles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This full-bodied wine relies more on its rich texture and nutty, mineral flavors than on the usual citrus and herb notes, so it's rather thick in profile. It has the heft of a Chardonnay and savory, almond-like accents that are worth appreciating."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Full of spice, ripe toastiness and rich apple flavors, this structured wine has good potential. Lively acidity brings out the citrus and freshness of the wine. Drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This 10-acre estate dates from the 16th century. Today, it has produced a solidly structured wine with firm tannins and a dense textured character. The black fruits are firm with considerable intensity and backed with spice and acidity. Drink from 2024."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of prune, red berry, graphite and mint lead the nose. The palate delivers raw red cherry, black pepper, anise and sage alongside bright acidity and compact tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A bit too hot for complete balance, the result of high alcohol. Other than that, it's rich, full bodied and delicious in berry, cassis and oak flavors."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The bouquet deals some peach, custard and a slight hint of oak, while the palate runs racy, fresh and citrusy. If you like a fresher style with strong orange and tropical fruit flavors, this is your ticket."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Made using organically farmed fruit, this is a fresh, steady and youthful expression. It boasts simple lines, with loads of lemony freshness on the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Lightly textured and velvety in feel, Judson Hale's Yorkville Highlands Pinot Noir has a bigger fruit expression than many of its brethren from cooler parts of the nearby Anderson Valley, with ripe red fruit front and center and a big, slightly woody finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah all aged in neutral oak, it's jazzy and appealing with notes of blue fruit, raspberry, smoked meat and peppery spices showing good purity and richness. It's nowhere near as weighty as the labeled alcohol level might suggest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Tight and compact, this delivers tangy, spicy intensity that's packed around a solid core of red fruit. The midpalate is driven by sensations of cherry, cassis and blackberry, and the finish shows signs of smoky barbecue and roasted chestnut."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This rich and structured wine is packed with both ripe black fruits and concentrated tannins. It is a big wine, a fine representation of this appellation with its dense flavors and aging potential. The wine should be ready from 2029."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Barbecue and lusty stews are what this wine wants. It's dryish to sweet in raisin, blackberry jam, chocolate, beef jerky and spice flavors, and the tannins are big and tough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of forest floor, baked plum, clove and a balsamic whiff of eucalyptus lead the nose. The firmly structured palate offers fleshy wild cherry, raspberry, star anise, tobacco and nutmeg alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2022–2028."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This wine's red apple, flower and lees aromas lead to off-dry, leesy fruit flavors that seem a bit heavy and weighed down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Whiffs of lychee and pink grapefruit accent fresh florals on this slightly off-dry Gewürztraminer. It's plush on the palate with juicy stone-fruit flavors, but also bright with lemony acidity. Finishes elegantly with a murmur of tea-leaf tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Spiced apple and light oak aromas are clean and attractive. This wine feels racy and pure, with good acidic kick. Flavors of nectarine and wood are compatible, while this barrel-fermented Viura (with 10% Malvasia) is solid on the finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Lighter-than-usual color and plenty of red cherry, raspberry and turned earth aromas. It offers low-level fruit flavors and good balance of acidity versus ripeness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This ripe, crisp and intensely fruity wine does have a touch of tannin, inevitable with Cabernet Franc, but it is really all about red fruits and refreshing acidity. Drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A creamy, smooth wine, flavored with pears, even lychees and full, ripe Grüner Veltliner. This shows the rich side of the grape, while still keeping its essential freshness. Typical pepper flavors come to finish. Glass stopper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Rusty in color, with aromas of compost and rotten leaves, this isn't cutting it. A drawing hard palate and burnt-out flavors that match the nose make this a hard road to navigate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Relatively soft with as much generous fruit as tannins. Some high-toast oak flavor needs to integrate, while showing great density and concentration. With power behind it, the wine will age seriously. Drink from 2023."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Basic, fresh, honest aromas of red-berry fruits and spice set up a wide, easygoing palate with cassis, blackberry and herbal flavors. Only on the finish does one detect some acidity and rawness. Overall this is a nice Cab for casual drinking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This Christian Roguenant wine, which translates to “Red Falcon,” offers a plump and inviting nose of black plum, cherry, cinnamon,and gingerbread aromas, with a touch of crushed slate. The palate tightens up remarkably, revealing gravel notes and dark berry fruit, proving minerally throughout the sip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Seamless, smoky, supple and seductive. Exotic sandalwood and Asian spices weave from the nose into the palate, wrapped around broad black cherry and blackberry fruit flavors. A darker streak of black olive and licorice runs into a finish replete with tannins that are tight and hint at stem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Shows weight, intense black-currant fruitiness and density from the high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Dark and brooding, it's likely to age for many years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Opens with aromas of toast, espresso, sunbaked earth and mature plum. The structured palate offers black cherries marinated in spirits, vanilla, toasted oak and coffee, while firm, fine-grained tannins provide the framework."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Blackberry and black cherry sauce aromas are given intrigue with tobacco leaf and sharp clove spice. Cinnamon stick and allspice shine on the very spicy palate, which is laid across a boysenberry backbone, with flecks of black pepper throughout."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Subtle and elegant, this opens with a smoky aroma that underscores delicate scents of orchard fruit, citrus and botanical herb. The aromas follow through to the linear palate along with a racy mineral vein. A note of cured meat closes the racy finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is an attractively fruity, soft wine. Balanced between acidity and a lightly crisp texture, it has a touch of yeast although it's the fresh citrus fruit that dominates."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is an easy, fruit-forward wine that would pair well with family dinners and simple pasta dishes. Cherry, bramble, wet earth, pressed violets and light coffee tones characterize the nose and are exactly what you should look for in a no-fuss Chianti. Vibrant berry flavors are carried forward thanks to the wine's smooth structure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A strong, toasted, smoky aroma and charred oak flavors define this medium-bodied, rich-textured wine. Not exactly light on its feet, but fans of oak will appreciate the bold, toasty, buttery character."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"There aren't that many organic Proseccos out there, and this expression from La Jara is thin, crisp and refreshing. There is a pungent grassy note at the outset that needs a few minutes to disappear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Rich, if a little one-dimensional, this has flavors of creamy orange, yellow apricot, vanilla and buttered toast. It will appeal to fans of the forward style of Chardonnay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Earth and black tea meet forest floor notes in this dark, brooding and powerfully full-bodied wine. A touch of reduction accentuates the profuse oak, recalling clove and cardamom, as tingling acidity vies for attention and integration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This Bordeaux-style blend, one of four from this tiny winery, is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon. The somewhat thin cranberry and raspberry fruit, high in acid, is not quite substantial enough to completely shed its candied character."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"With a notable orange tinge, the aromas offer notes of flowers and orange peel, seeming to show a touch of oxygen exposure. It drinks off dry, with abundant orange-rind and smoke flavors."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of charcuterie, smoke and grilled herb lead the nose. On the simple palate, a note of white pepper accents a red-berry core. It's easy drinking, with fresh acidity and soft tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is dry, silky and enormously complex, with flavors of raspberry, cherry, cola, new oak and spice that satisfy through the long finish. The mountain vineyard concentrated the fruit, yielding savory power. It's a beautiful Pinot Noir to drink now with steaks or lamb chops."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This wine has a jammy character with acidity that is unbalanced. Wine is made in cement tanks and aged in cement tanks and new and up to three-year-old French oak barrels."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Blueberry, dried lilac, crushed violet and black pepper form a classic nose on this Merlot-led Bordeaux blend from Paso Robles' celebrated Westside. The well-integrated, complex palate features fruit, herbs, spice and tar, as if each one plays back-to-back solos."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Aged partly in large casks, this has aromas that recall white flowers, stone fruit, chamomile, subtle oak and flint. The palate offers yellow apple, lemon zest, white peach and smoky graphite alongside fresh acidity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Made in a very ripe, supple style, this medium-bodied wine boasts plenty of dark cherry fruit. Hints of wind-blown dust give it a welcome non-fruity edge, while the silky tannins linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now–2024."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromas of flowers, green herb, pear and peach lead to silky sleek stone-fruit flavors. There's some interesting things going on but the fruit doesn't quite seem to have fully ripened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This lovely Ribolla Gialla offers thick richness and intensity that entices but never goes overboard. Lingering tones of peach, grapefruit and candied fruit fill in the rear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This wine is soft and round, with attractive acidity as well as a light sense of structure from tannins. It features considerable acidity along with wild strawberry flavors that keep it lifted and aromatic. Drink from 2012."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Delicately scented with white spring blossom and a whiff of tropical fruit, this medium-bodied white offers pineapple, ripe melon and nectarine zest. Lively acidity brightens the enveloping texture."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Floral and citric, with clean, juicy aromas that conjure memories of orange blossoms and fresh lime. The palate is light and mildly citric, with melon and papaya flavors bringing a tropical edge. Ready to drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"For a Syrah, this is soft, offering more of the smooth tannins than any bigger structure. It does have weight, with a dusty character and some juicy sweet plums and raisins, leavened by acidity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Concentrated yet balanced, this age-worthy wine is juicy in blackberry and currant, with a chewiness to the palate that gives it strength and power. Tar, tobacco and pencil lead shift around on the palate, before the wine finishes clean and sinewy. Cellar through 2026."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Smooth, sweet in fruit and easy to like. With its jammy flavors of blackberries and mocha, it's delicious, although it would benefit from greater complexity and not so much reliance on sheer intensity and oak."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Ripe fruit, in the form of raspberries, cherries and figs, characterizes this luscious Pinot. But it has much more going for it than that. The tannins are rich and complex, the finish is dry and spicy, and the overall impression is of wine with a great pedigree. Drink over the next six years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Perfumed and structured, this opens with a beautiful fragrance of intense violet layered with bright raspberry and balsamic notes. The palate has nice depth, delivering juicy wild cherry accented with vanilla, cinnamon, mocha and a note of Mediterranean herbs. It's nicely balanced with bright acidity and firm tannins that give it an age-worthy structure. Drink through 2030."}

On the juicy palate, menthol, licorice and baking spice accent a core of black cherry. Noble tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018–2023."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"A soft wine with attractive acidity, red-berry fruits and a gentle texture, the wine is ripe while keeping a backbone of mineral texture. Drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Scents of roasted nuts and apples gain levity on the palate with flavors of lemons and delicate white flowers. Richly textured, this has a slightly-viscous but refreshingly-fruity profile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"The timid nose squeaks out notes of Chinese five spice and warm green apple, with a slight hint of sulfur. Light to medium bodied, the palate bears a slight sweetness, tame acids and a quick finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Very tart, with a deep, tannic, earthy mineral streak. There's an iron\/earth streak running through all Abacela wines; here it comes across as iron and slightly bitter licorice. This is still very young and green; the score might well improve with more time in the bottle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"An exceptionally young wine that tastes like bacon and cherry syrup, this offers an overripe, concentrated and thick drink experience."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Terra Valentine's Pinot boasts fruit with long hangtime, and ripe flavors of raspberry and pomegranate. It's rather soft and oaky though so drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Zesty lime and green fern aromas rise from the glass. The palate merely adds a little green pear fruit to this refreshing and enlivening combo of utter cleanness and verve. The linearity and drive make this moreish, very exciting and totally lip-smacking. Echoes of pepper on the aftertaste make it even more intriguing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Creamy notes of pear still carry a hint of flinty smoke, but the pear notes rise with purity. The bright freshness of pure lemon lifts everything and makes for purity, ease, refreshment and blithe joy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This is a solidly built wine with ripe black-fruit flavors and lots of texture. It looks deeper than usual, smells like blackberries and black pepper, and tastes dry, full and firmly tannic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Vibrant and savory, this delivers wild cherry, dark raspberry, rosemary, mint and Mediterranean herb flavors alongside firm tannins. It closes on a licorice note."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Fresh-pressed blackberry aromas leap out of the glass of this wine, along with asphalt and a touch of purple flowers. The palate is a study of density and thickness, with black plums, coffee and espresso showing most out of the deep, black flavors."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Wiry berry aromas are jacked up with spice as well as stalky notes. There's a fair amount of astringency to the palate, while flavors of plum and red berries finish juicy but also briny and a touch horsey in flavor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Ripe and soft with rich apple flavor, there's a fullness to this wine. While elegant with a touch of maturity from bottle ageing, the palate is freshened a crispness and levity characteristic of the house style. It has enough weight to accompany food and is ready to drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Slightly backward, particularly given the vintage, the wine has a complex nose with plenty of dark fruit, Turkish delight, smoked meat and earth. A full rich palate, slightly soft, it begins to run out of steam a little in mid palate, but returns with a flourish, and the finish is long and nuanced. Will repay 5+ years of cellaring."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Ripe and plump blackberries shine through in a showcase of fruit purity, lifted by dried fennel, hot black gravel, peppercorns, toasted sesame and soy. There is tremendous structure and acidity on the sip, with black pepper and black-sesame nuance plus juicy boysenberry character to the mid-palate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Heavy wafts of petrol and oak dominate at first in this wine, before some air and some swirling in the glass reveal more lifted aromas and flavors of lemon candy, green apple and apple tart. A tale of two wines in some ways, it zigzags between crisp and luxurious, finding its balance in the glass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Ripe, juicy pear notes make nose and palate immensely appetizing. They are highlighted by zippy, fresh lemon accents that create a lovely balance on this fun, fresh summer wine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This splendid effort is sourced from the Durant Vineyard, and aged in neutral French oak for seven months prior to bottling. Spicy and dense, it's a lively blend of lime, apple, apricot and pear fruits. A trickle of juicy acidity pulls the flavors through into a finish with streaks of vanilla and clove."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"This appealing wine offers vanilla, café au lait, black currant, herbs and pepper. Silky-soft black olive flavors show good concentration and length backed by dry tannins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Gritty aromas of asphalt, green peppercorn, saucy berry and hard spices precede a tight palate with grating tannins. This is oak-heavy, with sweet-and-saucy red-berry flavors. An oaky, tomatoey finish is rubbery in feel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Aromatic herb, woodland berry, violet, citrus zest and tilled soil scents take shape in the glass. The succulent, linear palate doles out cranberry, red cherry white pepper and star anise flavors, bolstered by a backbone of firm, refined tannins and bright acidity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Shows lots of complexity, with a mèlange of blackberry, cherry, currant, mushu plum sauce, olive tapenade, black pepper and lightly oaked flavors that are wrapped into rich, sturdy tannins. Fine and dry, but a bit on edge now. Give it a year or two to soften."}
